- en: When I got into this field, I knew I would have to stay ahead of the tech curve.
    I spent many sleepless nights worming through my home network trying to learn
    the ropes. My practice paid off. After years of hard work and dedicated study,
    I founded a small but elite pen testing team. I was good, my *foo* strong. Networks
    fell prostrate before me. My co-workers looked up to me, and I thought I was The
    Man. Then I met Vince.

  zh: 当我进入这个领域时，我知道我必须紧跟技术潮流。我花了许多个不眠之夜在家庭网络中摸索学习。我的练习得到了回报。经过多年的努力和专心学习，我创建了一个小而精英的渗透测试团队。我很优秀，我的*foo*很强大。网络在我面前俯首称臣。我的同事们尊敬我，我以为自己是大人物。然后我遇到了文斯。
- en: In his mid-40s, hawk-eyed, and vaguely European looking, Vince blended in with
    the corporate crowd; he was most often seen in a black leather trench coat, a
    nice dress shirt, dark slacks, black wing tips and the occasional black fedora.
    He had a definite aura. Tales of his exploits were legendary. Some said he had
    been a fed, working deep-black projects for the government. Other insisted he
    was some kind of mercenary genius, selling his dark secrets to the highest bidder.

  zh: 文斯四十多岁，目光犀利，看起来有些欧洲风格，他与公司人群融为一体；他经常穿着一件黑色皮风衣，一件漂亮的衬衫，深色西裤，黑色翼尖鞋和偶尔戴着黑色礼帽。他有一种明显的气质。关于他的传奇故事传为佳话。有人说他曾是联邦调查局的一员，为政府从事深黑项目。其他人坚称他是某种雇佣兵天才，将他的黑暗秘密卖给出价最高的人。
- en: He was brilliant. He could do interesting and seemingly impossible things. He
    could pick locks, short-circuit electronic systems, and pluck information out
    of the air with fancy electronic gear. He once showed me a system he built called
    a “van Eck” something-or-other.^([1](#ft1)) It could sniff the electromagnetic
    radiation coming from a CRT and reassemble it, allowing him to eavesdrop on someone’s
    computer monitor from a quarter mile away. He taught me that a black-and-white
    TV could be used to monitor 900MHz cellular phone conversations. I still remember
    hunching over a table in my basement going at the UHF tuner post of an old black-and-white
    TV with a pair of needle-nosed pliers. When I heard a cellular phone conversation
    coming through that old TV’s speaker, I decided then and there I would learn everything
    I could from Vince.

  zh: 他很出色。他能做出有趣且看似不可能的事情。他能撬锁、短路电子系统，并用花哨的电子设备从空气中提取信息。他曾向我展示过他建造的一个叫做“范艾克”什么的系统。它可以嗅探来自CRT的电磁辐射并重新组装它，让他能够从四分之一英里外窃听某人电脑显示器上的内容。他教会我一台黑白电视可以用来监视900MHz的蜂窝电话通话。我仍然记得自己曾经驼背在地下室的桌子上，用一把长鼻钳在一台旧黑白电视的UHF调谐器上操作。当我听到那台旧电视的扬声器里传来一段蜂窝电话通话时，我决定从文斯那里学到一切。
- en: I was incredibly intimidated before our first gig. Fortunately, we had different
    roles. I was to perform an internal assessment, which emulated an insider threat.
    If an employee went rogue, he could do unspeakable damage to a network. In order
    to properly emulate this, our clients provided us a workspace, a network jack,
    and the username and password of a legitimate, non-administrative user. I was
    tasked with leveraging those credentials to gain administrative control of critical
    network systems. If I gained access to confidential records stored within a corporate
    database, for example, my efforts were considered successful. I had a near-perfect
    record with internal assessments and was confident in my abilities.

  zh: 在我们的第一个工作之前，我感到非常害怕。幸运的是，我们有不同的角色。我负责执行内部评估，模拟内部威胁。如果一名员工走上歧途，他可能对网络造成无法言喻的破坏。为了正确模拟这一点，我们的客户为我们提供了一个工作空间、一个网络插孔，以及一个合法的非管理员用户的用户名和密码。我的任务是利用这些凭证获取对关键网络系统的管理权限。例如，如果我成功访问了存储在公司数据库中的机密记录，那么我的努力就被认为是成功的。我在内部评估方面几乎有完美的记录，对自己的能力充满信心。

    threat. The facility had top-notch physical security. They had poured a ton of
    money into expensive locks, sensors, and surveillance gear. I knew Vince would
    obliterate them all with his high-tech superpowers. The gig looked to be a real

- en: When Vince insisted I help him with the physical part of the assessment, I just
    about fell over. I imagined a James Bond movie, with Vince as “Q” and myself (of
    course) as James Bond in ninja assault gear. Vince would supply the gadgets, like
    the van Eck thingamabob and I would infiltrate the perimeter and spy on their
    surveillance monitors or something. I giggled to myself about the unnatural things
    we would do to the electronic keypad systems or the proximity locks. I imagined
    the looks on the guard’s faces when we duct-taped them to their chairs after silently
    rappelling down from the ceiling of the surveillance room.

    we would use to pop the security. When he told me he hadn’t brought any gadgets,

    didn’t bring any gear, I briefly considered pushing him over, but I had heard
    he was a black belt in like six different martial arts, so I just politely asked
    him what the heck he was thinking. He said we were going to be creative. The mercenary
    genius, the storm center of all the swirling rumors, hadn’t brought any gear.
    I asked him how creative a person could be when attacking a highly secured building
    without any gear. He just looked at me and gave me this goofy grin. I’ll never

- en: We spent the morning checking out the site. It consisted of several multistory
    buildings and a few employee parking lots, all enclosed by protective fencing.
    Everyone came and went through a front gate. Fortunately, the gate was open and

    view of the loading docks.

    them and left. Just like that. I’m skipping the description of my heart pounding
    at 400 beats per minute and the thoughts of what military prison would be like
    and whether or not the rumors about Bubba were true, but I did it. And it was
    an incredible rush. It was social engineering at its simplest, and it worked wonders.
    No one questioned me. I suppose it was just too awkward for them. I couldn’t hide

    were no loading docks and the only visible entrance was the front door. It was
    wood and steel—too much like a castle door for my taste—and approximately six
    inches thick, sporting a proximity card-reader device. We watched as employees
    swiped a badge, pulled open the doors and walked in. I suggested we tailgate.
    I was on a roll. Vince shook his head. He obviously had other plans. He walked
    towards the building and slowed as we approached the front door. Six feet from
    the door, he stopped. I walked a step past him and turned around, my back to the

    He pulled up in front of the hotel, parked, and told me to wait for him. He emerged
    a few minutes later with a wire coat hanger and a damp washcloth. He tossed them

    We were headed back to the site. “The front door of that facility,” he continued,
    “is formidable. It uses a very heavy-duty magnetic bolting system. My guess is

    the hanger, creating one long straight piece of strong, thin wire. He folded it
    in half, laid the washcloth on one end and folded the end of the hanger around

    I watch people. To me, strangers are an interesting puzzle and I reflexively try
    to figure out as much about them as I can. When I pass a businessman in an airport,
    my mind goes into overdrive as I try to sense his seat number and social status;
    make out his medical problems; fathom his family situation (or sense his sexual
    orientation); figure out his financial standing; infer his income level; deduce
    his dietary habits; and have a guess at his home address. When I go to a restaurant,
    I drift in and out of conversations around me, siphoning interesting tidbits of
    information. My attention wanders as I analyze my surroundings, taking it all
    in. When I walk through the parking lot of a building, I check out the vehicles
    along the way to determine what goes on inside and who the building’s residents
    might be. I do all this stuff not because of my undiagnosed attention deficit
    disorder but because it’s become a habit as a result of my job. I have personally
    witnessed the power of perception. When faced with tough security challenges,
    I don’t charge. I hang back and I watch. A good dose of heightened perception
    levels the playing field every time.

  zh: 无技术黑客的关键在于简单思考，保持警觉，并且睁大眼睛，抬高头。例如，当我去商场或其他人群密集的地方时，我会观察人群。对我来说，陌生人是一个有趣的谜题，我会本能地尽可能多地了解他们。当我在机场遇到一个商人时，我的大脑会超负荷运转，试图感知他的座位号和社会地位；了解他的健康问题；理解他的家庭状况（或感知他的性取向）；推断他的财务状况；推测他的收入水平；推断他的饮食习惯；猜测他的家庭地址。当我去餐厅时，我会在周围的对话中游走，吸取有趣的信息片段。我的注意力漫游，分析周围的环境，吸收一切。当我走过建筑物的停车场时，我会查看沿途的车辆，以确定内部发生了什么，建筑物的居民可能是谁。我做所有这些事情不是因为我有未被诊断出的注意力缺陷障碍，而是因为这已经成为我的工作习惯。我亲眼见证了感知的力量。面对严峻的安全挑战时，我不冲动。我退后一步，静观其变。一次良好的感知水平总能使局势平衡。
