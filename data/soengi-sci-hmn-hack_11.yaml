    In one organization, they tried to give away one $5 gift card per quarter to those
    who stayed in the ideal behavior group for the whole quarter. The gift was too
    small to be a motivator. The reward needs to motivate, but that doesn''t mean
    it has to be a brand-new 60-inch flat-screen TV or a year''s salary. It just has

    who have stayed in the ideal behavior group for X months. Some call out “Star

    you invite me, please have salad or something healthy so Josh won''t get mad at
    me), and they have a short speech or video or presentation about some security
    topic that benefits those who attend. Sure, those who attend may do so at first

- en: '**Top-down Reinforcement** This one seems to have almost mystical powers, as
    if you put a spell on your population. When the CEO lets the group know they are
    also getting phished with the employee population each month and how he or she
    fared, it gives a very clear message of “we are in this together … for reals.”
    In one organization I worked with, the initial reaction to the phishing program
    was less than ideal. In one extreme case, a woman who took all the wrong actions
    when receiving the phish was so angry, she demanded that I get on the phone, and
    she spent 10 minutes chewing me out. She told me what an awful person I am and
    how I need to reevaluate my life course. A few months later, the CEO of this massive
    organization held an all hands corporate meeting. In that meeting, the CEO mentioned
    the phishing program; he explained that he got phished like everyone else, and
    he was learning that he needed to be more aware. As if some mystical talisman
    was waved over the population, anger ceased to exist, aggression toward my SE
    team was lessened drastically, and we saw a much larger percentage of compliance.
    Sometimes the population feels they are being singled out to be made to look dumb.
    This can cause an adversarial relationship, and getting the top management of
    the company to support the initiative can really help.'

    我曾与一个组织合作，该组织对钓鱼计划的初始反应不尽理想。在一个极端案例中，一名女性在收到钓鱼邮件时采取了所有错误的行动，她非常生气，要求我打电话，她花了10分钟责骂我。她告诉我我是一个可怕的人，需要重新评估我的人生道路。几个月后，这家大型组织的CEO举行了一次全员企业会议。在会议上，CEO提到了钓鱼计划；他解释说他像其他人一样被钓鱼攻击，他正在意识到自己需要更加警觉。仿佛有一种神秘的护身符在员工群体上挥舞，愤怒消失了，对我的SE团队的攻击大大减少，我们看到了更大比例的遵从。有时员工群体会觉得他们被单独挑出来被当作愚蠢的样子。这可能导致对抗性关系，让公司的高层管理支持这一倡议真的有助于解决问题。'
