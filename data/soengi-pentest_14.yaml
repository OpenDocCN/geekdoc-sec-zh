    for a pass or a meeting room, and this can be accomplished without ever setting
    foot on-site. However, as scarily effective as attacks of this kind are, they
    will likely fall short in businesses with a higher than average level of security.
    If the client has mature and tested security controls then the focus might need
    to be on the attributes of the actual building itself. Therefore, the telephone

    but it is extremely useful. The fact we’re calling the security office obviously
    tells us they have a security guard, if only to watch the cameras. It was also
    discovered that to enter reception without speaking to them, a pass is needed.
    There is a car park and it’s secured with a barrier. Finally, the fact that a
    pass is not required to move around inside is critical; if access can be gained,
    it means free movement from department to department, floor to floor, without
    needing a pass or even to tailgate. This means that potentially an attacker could
    just tailgate in one of the entrances and be able to move around inside freely.
    If this is the case, then a tailgating scenario should be attempted at some point
    during the assessment.

    summer. Identifying this physical vulnerability remotely would be challenging
    to say the least. However, this is not just talking about the painfully obvious
    physical vulnerabilities such as open doors, there is a huge amount of critical
    information that can be gathered on the target business, the employees and the
    physical security controls by actually visiting the site. As mentioned above,

    rummaging through someone’s garbage is hardly the pinnacle of psychological manipulation,
    but it’s not the act itself, it’s how the information is used. Is it legal? That
    depends on the intention, whether it’s a residence or a business and what country
    that the act is being carried out. Whether or not taking garbage is considered
    theft is debatable, but if the garbage is stored on company property then there
    will certainly be an aspect of trespassing if there is an attempt to obtain it
    without permission. However, in terms of a social engineering assessment, permission
    should have been granted to execute such scenarios.

    an inspector from the xyzgarbage company will be coming to site to do some basic
    checks. Then by arriving as the xyzgarbage inspector, the only challenge would
    be to convince the security guard of the need to be left alone, “*I have quite
    a bit to do, shall I come see you again on my way out?*”. Or the engineer could
    impersonate an employee and explain to the security guard that an important document

    a look through the bins?

    USB drives, hard drives, scraps of paper containing passwords, network diagrams,
    documents with lists of employees, etc. This is the obvious stuff and there shouldn’t

    be. If there is one practical piece of advice the authors can give regarding dumpster
    driving, it would be to consider ANY piece of business specific information that
    isn’t already known as being useful. Yes, finding passwords on Post-It notes would
    be fantastic, but don’t dismiss other potentially key pieces of information. For
    example, what about finding a printout of an e-mail conversation that someone
    has binned. Can the knowledge of that conversation be used to advantage to gain
    credibility? Has an employee thrown away some delivery parcel packaging along
    with the receipt that’s usually included? As this will contain details of the
    item and delivery, that enables the impersonation; either of the business that
    provided the item or the delivery company that dropped it off.

- en: Shoulder surfing is another information gathering technique that is often described
    as social engineering. However, in the similar way to dumpster diving, it is not
    the technique itself but the way the gathered information is used. In its most
    basic sense, shoulder surfing is looking over someone’s shoulder to see what they
    are doing; typing, writing, etc. For example, an employee may covertly look across
    at their colleague’s keyboard as they type their password or look at a monitor
    as an e-mail is being composed.

  zh: 肩部窃听是另一种经常被描述为社会工程学的信息收集技术。然而，与搜垃圾一样，重要的不是技术本身，而是如何使用所收集的信息。在最基本的意义上，肩部窃听是偷看别人在做什么的一种行为；输入、写作等。例如，一名员工可能会在同事输入密码时偷偷看他们的键盘，或者在撰写电子邮件时查看显示器。
- en: It could be argued that there would be little benefit in employing this technique,
    as access to the target building has already been achieved. Having breached the
    security, knowing an employee’s password may be of some use, but it would be far
    easier to plug in a device and attack the network remotely. This is true, but
    the employees are not “always” within the target building. For example, although
    very much a long game technique, an attacker could shoulder surf an employee using
    their laptop in a local cafe. If the password could be seen, it could then be
    used to access the corporate e-mail. This could then be used to launch phishing
    e-mail attacks.

  zh: 可以争论说采用这种技术没有什么好处，因为已经实现了对目标建筑物的访问。虽然已经突破了安全，知道员工的密码可能会有些用处，但更容易的方法是插入设备并远程攻击网络。这是正确的，但员工并不是“总是”在目标建筑物内。例如，尽管是一种长期的技术，但攻击者可以在当地咖啡馆通过窥视员工使用笔记本电脑。如果密码可以看到，那么就可以用来访问企业电子邮件。然后可以用此来发起钓鱼邮件攻击。
- en: Looking for passwords is obvious, but remember that a social engineer can potentially
    use any information to attack the business. Consider the cafe example again, what
    else could the attacker see? They would be able to see operating system version,
    the web browser, the software they’re using, and the make and model of the laptop.
    This is all very useful information that can aid an attacker when launching phishing
    attacks. Knowing the software used can narrow down the attacks that are likely
    to work.

  zh: 摄影
- en: When targeting a physical building, the idea of taking photographs seems like
    a sensible thing to do. There have been many examples in the movies and television
    shows where a team of professionals covertly photograph the target building and
    the associated employees. Is this necessary in modern-day social engineering?
    The rather predictable answer is that it depends. Generally speaking photographing
    the building is often not necessary, as a quick visit to GoogleMaps Streetview
    will provide clear enough shots of the building’s exterior. If online photographs
    cannot be obtained then resorting to employing time to take photographs instead
    is only really necessary if there is something relevant to include in the report.
    The fact is, the client knows what their building looks like, they go there every
    day. Therefore, including a selection of photographs of the exterior won’t be
    that useful to them. However, if it is difficult to get close enough to take photos,
    due to security controls, then doing so proves certain vulnerabilities. In this
    sense, the act of taking the photographs becomes significant. Another situation
    where photographs of the building should be included is if they point out a specific
    vulnerability. For example, a particular assessment performed by the authors revealed
    an external doorway secured with a cheap pin-tumbler lock. Above the door were
    three security cameras mounted on a pole, none of which covered the door or the
    pathway leading to the door. This was an obvious issue and so photographs were
    included.

  zh: 当针对一个实体建筑时，拍照的想法似乎是个明智的选择。在电影和电视节目中，有许多例子是专业团队秘密拍摄目标建筑和相关员工。在当今社会工程学中，这是必要的吗？相当可预测的答案是取决于具体情况。一般来说，拍摄建筑物通常是不必要的，因为快速访问GoogleMaps街景将提供足够清晰的建筑外部照片。如果无法获取在线照片，那么花时间拍照就只有在报告中包含相关内容时才真正必要。事实上，客户知道他们的建筑长什么样，他们每天都去那里。因此，包括一些建筑外部的照片对他们来说不会太有用。然而，如果由于安全控制而难以靠近拍照，那么这样做就会暴露出某些漏洞。从这个意义上讲，拍摄照片的行为变得重要起来。另一个应该包括建筑物照片的情况是如果它们指出了特定的漏洞。例如，作者进行的某项特定评估揭示了一个用廉价的插销锁定的外部门。门上方有三台安装在杆上的安全摄像头，没有一台摄像头覆盖门或通向门的路径。这是一个明显的问题，因此包括了照片。
- en: Once access has been gained to the building, photographs are usually used to
    “prove” access to the objective. Therefore, photographs may be taken of a restricted
    area or a particular object defined in the scope of the assessment. However, this
    is use of photography to prove an objective has been met, not for the purposes
    of active information gathering.

- en: If the target site is very high security and the possibility of being caught
    on camera is likely, then photography can be useful to map out certain security
    controls. Once the location, direction, make and model of the cameras has been
    ascertained, theoretically scenarios can be made to avoid them. However, this
    would only be necessary if planning a “smash and grab” approach whereby all activity
    needed to be convert. Remember that scenarios of this type are risky, only identify
    a handful of vulnerabilities, may not map to the client’s actual risks and should
    always be attempted last.

    leverage an employee’s access privileges by following closely behind them as they
    authenticate to physical security controls such as RFID. Most of us are socially
    conditioned to hold a door open for people behind to be polite and courteous.
    If the door isn’t held open, the person behind may be offended. If simply not

    to open and close the door behind them. This method is seemingly effective but
    only against short game attack scenarios. The employees are all fully aware of
    the procedure, but new third-party contractors and visitors won’t be. If an attacker
    could find out when such a contractor or visitor is due to arrive, they could
    tailgate behind. Additionally, a social engineer could arrive as a visitor with
    a colleague tailgating behind.

- en: There are other, more expensive solutions such as single person turnstiles or
    the ultimate man-trap authentication system. These physical security controls
    are specifically designed to prevent tailgating. For example, with a man-trap
    an individual has to be authenticated once to enter a small space that can generally
    only accommodate one person. They then become “trapped” within the compartment
    until they are authenticated a second time. Some systems will actually assign
    a weight to an individual’s authentication details, to ensure they’re not literally
    carrying someone else through the system. Although these systems prevent tailgating
    they are not without their vulnerabilities. For example, the authors have seen
    man-trap systems that allow the same card to be used to enter the system multiple
    times, rather than having to leave first. This means that a valid pass could be
    used to allow multiple individuals through.

    majority of cases, the damage will not affect the lock, but the chance is always
    there. Therefore, it is important to include this in the rules of engagement with
    the client. They need to be aware of the risk, however small, and make a decision
    as to whether the technique can be used. The importance of this became very clear
    with one particular client who stipulated from the very beginning that under no
    circumstances was lock picking to be attempted. When inquires were made as to
    why, the client stated that previous consultants had used the techniques without
    informing them. What those consultants didn’t realize is that if any one lock
    was damaged and had to be replaced, then every other single lock would also need
    to be replaced. The cost of doing this was huge in this particular situation.
    Therefore, attempts to carry out any lock picking were avoided, but as part of
    the assessment additional security controls in certain areas were recommended,
    as real attackers wouldn’t care if the locks were damaged or not.
