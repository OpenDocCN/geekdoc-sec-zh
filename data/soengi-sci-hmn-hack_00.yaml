- en: 'When I started Apple Computers in 1976 with Steve Jobs, I did not imagine where
    that invention would take the world. I wanted to do something that was unheard
    of: create a personal computer. One that any person could use, enjoy, and benefit
    from. Jump forward only a short 40 or so years and that vision is a reality.'

  zh: 1976年，我与史蒂夫·乔布斯创办苹果电脑时，我没有想象到那项发明将带给世界什么。我想做一些前所未有的事情：创造一台个人电脑。一台任何人都可以使用、享受和受益的个人电脑。跳到短短的40年左右，那个愿景已经成为现实。
- en: With billions of personal computers around the globe, smartphones, smart devices,
    and technology being embedded into every aspect of our lives, it is important
    to take a step back and look at how we maintain safety and security while still
    innovating and growing and working with the next generation.

  zh: 全球有数十亿台个人电脑，智能手机、智能设备和技术嵌入到我们生活的方方面面，重要的是要退一步，看看我们如何在创新和成长的同时保持安全和安全，并与下一代合作。
- en: I love getting to work with youth today, inspiring them to innovate and grow.
    I love seeing the ideas flow from them as they figure out new and creative ways
    to use technology. And I truly love being able to see how this technology can
    enhance people's lives.

  zh: 我喜欢与今天的年轻人一起工作，激励他们创新和成长。我喜欢看到他们从中涌现的想法，因为他们找到了使用技术的新颖和创造性方式。我真心喜欢看到这项技术如何增强人们的生活。
- en: With that said, we need to take a serious look at how we secure this future.
    In 2004 when I gave the keynote speech at HOPE Conference, I said that a lot of
    hacking is playing with other people and getting them to do strange things. My
    friend, Kevin Mitnick, has mastered this over the years in one area of security
    called social engineering.

  zh: 话虽如此，我们需要认真审视如何保护这个未来。2004年，当我在HOPE大会上发表主题演讲时，我说过，很多黑客行为是与其他人一起玩耍，并让他们做出奇怪的事情。我的朋友凯文·米特尼克多年来已经在一种安全领域——社会工程学中掌握了这一点。
- en: Chris’s book captures the very essence of social engineering, defining and shaping
    it for all of us to understand. He has rewritten the book on it again, defining
    the core principles of how we as humans make decisions and how those very same
    processes can be manipulated.

  zh: 克里斯的书捕捉了社会工程的本质，为我们所有人定义并塑造了它。他再次重新定义了这个领域的核心原则，说明了我们作为人类如何做出决策，以及这些决策过程如何被操纵。
- en: Hacking has been around for a while, and human hacking has been around for as
    long as humans have. This book can prepare you, protect you, and educate you how
    to recognize, defend, and mitigate the risks that come from social engineering.
