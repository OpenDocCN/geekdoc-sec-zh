- en: Companies invest millions of dollars each year in the latest security products,
    from firewalls to access-card systems, but they fail to invest in their most valuable
    resources in securing their environments—more specifically, their employees. All
    too often, security-awareness training is a once-a-year event involving dated
    and unengaging material that is largely ignored. The result is that employees
    lack understanding of modern-day attacks and their ramifications. This knowledge
    gap presents endless opportunities for attackers. In Building a Security Awareness
    Program, Bill Gardner and Valerie Thomas have detailed the steps for building
    an entire security-awareness program from scratch. The book also serves as a guidebook
    for those seeking to improve or modernize their existing security-awareness programs.

  zh: 公司每年投入数百万美元购买最新的安全产品，从防火墙到门禁系统，但他们未能投资于保护环境中最宝贵的资源——更具体地说，是他们的员工。往往情况是，安全意识培训是一年一度的事件，涉及过时且乏味的材料，很大程度上被忽视。结果是员工缺乏对现代攻击及其后果的理解。这种知识缺口为攻击者提供了无穷无尽的机会。在《构建安全意识计划》中，比尔·加德纳（Bill
    Gardner）和瓦莱丽·托马斯（Valerie Thomas）详细介绍了从零开始构建整个安全意识计划的步骤。该书还为那些希望改进或现代化现有安全意识计划的人提供了指南。
- en: Personally, I have used this knowledge gap to my advantage in my past life as
    a black-hat hacker and throughout my time as a security consultant. I have accessed
    thousands of systems by combining social engineering with technical attacks. During
    a recent penetration test, I obtained access to a client's network by e-mailing
    a malicious document that appeared to originate from one of the client's vendors.
    All it took was one click of a mouse and I was in. A few days later, I had access
    to the client's entire corporate network, source code, financials, and more.

  zh: 就个人而言，在我以前的生活中作为黑帽骇客以及作为安全顾问期间，我利用了这种知识缺口。我通过将社会工程与技术攻击相结合，访问了成千上万个系统。在最近的一次渗透测试中，我通过电子邮件发送了一个恶意文档，看起来是来自客户供应商之一的。只需点击鼠标一次，我就进入了。几天后，我访问了客户的整个企业网络、源代码、财务情况等等。
- en: While phishing is a popular attack vector, other types of attacks still pose
    threats. The stories in the social engineering chapter may seem too good to be
    true, but they describe actual events. Thomas and Gardner have performed these
    attacks during penetration tests on unsuspecting employees and were successful
    every time. The best technologies in the world won't protect you if an attacker
    can walk right through the front door unchallenged. In [Chapter 12](B9780124199675000120.xhtml),
    “Bringing It All Together,” Thomas and Gardner define the steps needed not only
    to build an awareness program but also to begin the process of empowering the
    employee to challenge and verify suspicious behavior.

  zh: 虽然钓鱼是一种常见的攻击向量，但其他类型的攻击仍然构成威胁。社会工程章节中的故事可能看起来过于美好，但它们描述的是真实事件。托马斯和加德纳在对毫无防备的员工进行渗透测试时执行了这些攻击，并且每次都成功了。即使世界上最好的技术也无法保护您，如果攻击者可以毫无阻碍地通过前门进入。在第12章《汇聚一切》中，托马斯和加德纳定义了不仅构建意识计划所需的步骤，还有开始赋予员工挑战和验证可疑行为的过程。
- en: As attacks become more focused, organizations must adapt their defenses to include
    the human element of security. Creating an awareness program from the ground up
    can be intimidating and overwhelming. Building a Security Awareness Program walks
    you through the step-by-step process of creating a program as unique as your organization
    so you'll be prepared when an attacker comes calling.

- en: This book to me is one of the fundamental books that should be used in building
    an information security program and understanding what risks are really out there.
    For me, one of the largest risks we face in security today is through the human
    element. Bill and Valerie have done an amazing job in showing both the effectiveness
    of the types of attacks that can happen and most importantly how to build a successful
    program that aims at reducing the risks associated with targeted attacks. When
    I was a chief security officer for a Fortune 1000, building an education and awareness
    program was one of my most accomplishing moments. Not only did the awareness program
    give the security team an elevated detection capability with our employee population,
    but also it started to change the culture to something that was security-driven.
    When we implemented something in our organization, it wasn't because security
    was doing it to be draconian or overprotective—our employees actually understood
    that it was part of a much larger picture. A mission that mattered. Our program
    skyrocketed and moved at an escalated pace with executives and IT working for
    one goal alike. All because of our awareness program.

  zh: 这本书对我来说是建立信息安全计划和了解真正风险的基础书籍之一。对我来说，我们今天在安全领域面临的最大风险之一是通过人为因素。比尔和瓦莱丽在展示可能发生的攻击类型的有效性以及如何构建一个成功的计划以减少与有针对性攻击相关的风险方面做得非常出色。当我担任财富1000强公司的首席安全官时，建立教育和意识计划是我最有成就感的时刻之一。意识计划不仅提高了安全团队对员工群体的检测能力，而且开始改变文化，使之成为以安全为导向的文化。当我们在组织中实施某项措施时，不是因为安全要严厉或过度保护——我们的员工实际上理解这是一个更大的画面的一部分。一个有意义的使命。我们的计划迅速发展，并以高速度与高管和IT部门为了一个共同目标而努力。所有这一切都是因为我们的意识计划。
- en: Flash forward and look at the attacks that are occurring. Our perimeter is getting
    better and we're locking down more things. Hackers move to the past of least resistance
    and that is our end-user population right now. We have to take action, we have
    to train our people, and most importantly, it has to matter to them. Education
    and awareness works, and I can prove it with folks that we work with all the time.
    I've seen awareness transform an entire company to be a security-driven one on
    a number of occasions. Focus less on the technology, and focus on the fundamental
    blocks of educating your users.

  zh: 快进看看正在发生的攻击。我们的边界变得更加安全，我们正在锁定更多的东西。黑客转向最薄弱的环节，那就是我们的终端用户群体。我们必须采取行动，我们必须培训我们的人员，最重要的是，这对他们来说必须是重要的。教育和意识是有效的，我可以通过我们一直与之合作的人证明这一点。我曾多次看到意识将整个公司转变为一个以安全为导向的公司。不要过多关注技术，而是关注教育用户的基本要素。
- en: I've read a lot of books in my time, but this one is different. It's a way to
    build a successful security-awareness program, a way to pave your INFOSEC program
    forward, and a way to train users in a way that makes it possible to detect attacks.
    I'm such a big advocate on bringing awareness to corporations and employees; it's
    one of the most returns you will ever get on an investment. The blend that Bill
    and Valerie bring on showing successful attacks that have occurred in the wild
    and following it up with how to proactively defend is brilliant.

  zh: 我读过很多书，但这本书与众不同。这是建立成功的安全意识计划的方法，是推动你的信息安全计划前进的方法，也是训练用户以便检测攻击的方法。我非常支持向公司和员工提高意识；这是你将获得的最大回报之一。比尔和瓦莱丽展示了野外成功攻击的混合，并紧随其后的积极防御方法是非常出色的。

    and figure out how to implement everything that you've learned here. These words
    of advice come from experience and what works. Your program, your visibility,
