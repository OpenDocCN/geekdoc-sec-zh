  zh: 作为一个高度依赖技术的大型公司，索尼过去经常成为网络攻击的目标。
- en: To provide flexibility for their diverse divisions, Sony operated a flexible
    approach to the security of their systems, allowing each group of companies to
    implement and manage what each required, at the same time as having some overall
    security systems that operated across all divisions.

    new technologies to help expand and deliver products to fulfill customer needs

- en: This strategy can work well, but entails much higher operating costs than top-down
    security enforcement does.  When running security separately for each division,
    it is vital to understand what the responsibilities and boundaries are for each
    section.  Adequate funding must be in place, and it must be sufficient to allow
    each division to manage a comprehensive approach to security, including all the
    components we have explored in this book.

    (as outlined in the previous chapter), and, at the time, could not be blocked

- en: Based on the extent of the infiltration and the resulting damage, it is evident
    that a key root cause was the large number of gaps in the defense layers.  Overall,
    the amount of data that was taken indicates that data loss prevention tools at
    network and device levels were either bypassed or absent; either way, these tools
    proved to be ineffective.

  zh: 根据渗透的程度和造成的损害，很明显一个关键的根本原因是防御层中存在大量的漏洞。总的来说，被窃取的数据量表明网络和设备级别的数据丢失预防工具被绕过或缺失；无论哪种情况，这些工具都被证明是无效的。
- en: Although it was (at that time) nearly impossible to fully protect a system against
    an attack that uses polymorphic malware, the malware itself mostly leverages known
    exploits for which protective measures already existed.  This means that although
    an attack using polymorphic malware can create damage, the scale and impact can
    be substantially reduced when all other security measures are operating effectively.

    unable to rapidly update their intrusion detection and prevention routines to

    to an attack of this magnitude.

    at least for email systems, were either nonexistent or highly deficient.  Automatically
    removing and destroying email after a specific, limited time period, unless it
    was explicitly earmarked for retention, would have substantially reduced the impact
    of the data exposure.

    involved disaffected former employees leveraging inside information.  Part of
    the rationale for this accusation is that the extent of the damage and infiltration
