  zh: 谷歌及其中国黑客
- en: In the beginning of 2010, Google made the headlines and revealed that Chinese
    hackers were able to breach a part of its system.  Google claimed that some of
    its services were breached and that the perpetrators wanted to obtain access to
    Chinese human rights activists through their Gmail accounts.  Apart from Google,
    these social engineers also targeted other prominent companies, including Symantec,
    Adobe Systems, and Yahoo.

  zh: 2010年初，谷歌登上了头条新闻，并透露称中国黑客成功侵入了其系统的一部分。谷歌声称其部分服务受到了侵犯，而肇事者想要通过他们的Gmail账户获取中国人权活动人士的访问权限。除了谷歌，这些社会工程师还针对其他知名公司进行了攻击，包括赛门铁克、Adobe
    Systems和雅虎。
- en: The success of the social engineers was due to spending weeks and even months
    of scouting and targeting Google employees in order to obtain information.  They
    began by using the information of employees found in social networks and other
    places.  Once they got the necessary information, the social engineers sent messages
    to the employees that appeared legitimate and coming from a friend or contact. 
    Thinking that the message truly came from their friends, the employees clicked
    on the links embedded with malware, resulting to the installation of spyware on
    their computers.

  zh: 社会工程师的成功是由于花费了数周甚至数月的时间在对谷歌员工进行侦察和定位，以获取信息。他们首先利用在社交网络和其他地方找到的员工信息。一旦他们获得了必要的信息，社会工程师就向员工发送了看起来合法并来自朋友或联系人的消息。认为消息真的来自朋友，员工点击了嵌有恶意软件的链接，导致间谍软件被安装在他们的计算机上。
- en: This attack on Google was planned and carried out for a considerable period. 
    The social engineers took their time in gathering information and winning the
    confidence of the employees so that they could interact and elicit information.

  zh: 这次针对谷歌的攻击是经过精心策划和实施的，持续了相当长的一段时间。社会工程师花了很多时间收集信息，赢得员工的信任，以便能够进行互动并获取信息。
- en: Given that most companies make use of social networks as a part of the marketing
    strategy, social engineers find it easier to gather information about their targets. 
    Apart from conveying their marketing tactics through social media, companies also
    expose their company structure, making the information needed by social engineers
    readily available.

  zh: 鉴于大多数公司将社交网络作为营销策略的一部分，社会工程师发现更容易收集有关其目标的信息。除了通过社交媒体传达他们的营销策略外，公司还暴露了他们的公司结构，使社会工程师所需的信息易于获取。

  zh: 同样，在2010年，高度机密的政府信息被社会工程师成功地暴露在维基解密上。
- en: Bradley Manning, a U.S. Army soldier who was then assigned to a support battalion
    in Iraq, was accused of providing classified information to the founder of Wikileaks,
    Julian Assange.

  zh: 布拉德利·曼宁，一名被派驻在伊拉克支援营的美国陆军士兵，被指控向维基解密的创始人朱利安·阿桑奇提供机密信息。
- en: Having access to the Secret Internet Protocol Router Network, which was used
    by the U.S. Department of State and Department of Defense for transmitting classified
    information, Manning was able to obtain the material.

  zh: 曼宁能够获取材料是因为他有权访问被美国国务院和国防部用于传输机密信息的秘密互联网协议路由器网络。
- en: Meanwhile, Adrian Lamo, a former hacker, reported Manning to the authorities,
    telling the officials that Manning downloaded the material from SIPRNet and saving
    it on CD-RWs.  Manning was allegedly successful in fooling his colleagues that
    he was merely listening to music instead of accessing and downloading classified
    information.

  zh: 与此同时，前黑客阿德里安·拉莫向当局报告了曼宁，告诉官员曼宁从SIPRNet下载了材料并将其保存在CD-RWs上。据称，曼宁成功地欺骗了他的同事，让他们以为他只是在听音乐，而不是访问和下载机密信息。
- en: Manning carried out his ploy by coming in with music on a CD-RW with a label,
    such as “Lady Gaga.”  He erased the music, overwriting it with a compressed split
    file.  Manning told Lamo in an online chat that nobody from his colleagues suspected
    anything as he listened and even lip-synched Lady Gaga's song, Telephone.  While
    doing this, he “exfiltrated” probably the most magnanimous information spillage
    in the history of the United States.

  zh: 曼宁通过带有标签的CD-RW上的音乐进行了他的诡计，比如“Lady Gaga”。他擦除了音乐，用压缩的分割文件覆盖了它。曼宁在在线聊天中告诉拉莫，他的同事们没有人怀疑任何事情，因为他听着甚至跟着唱着Lady
    Gaga的歌曲《Telephone》。在这样做的同时，他“外泄”了美国历史上可能最慷慨的信息泄露。
- en: Manning was able to play on the trust of his colleagues while keeping his cool. 
    A social engineer like Manning is ruthless as he knew his action may result in
    a court martial, yet still pushed through with it.

  zh: 曼宁能够利用他同事的信任，同时保持冷静。像曼宁这样的社会工程师是无情的，因为他知道他的行动可能导致军事法庭审判，但他仍然坚持下去。
- en: Following the exposure of highly classified information on Wikileaks, other
    social engineers took advantage and sent out messages with a pickup line, “Do
    you want to read the file on Wikileaks?  Click here.”  Once users clicked on the
    link, it led them to a pdf file that allowed the social engineers to search the
    computer through a Javascript, determine the Adobe reader version on the computer,
    and launched their exploitation for such version.  The victims did not mind if
    the pdf took time to load as they were expecting a huge document.  However, they
    also did not know that it was not the document that took time to load, but the
    malware, which the social engineers embedded.

  zh: 在维基解密曝光高度机密信息后，其他社会工程师利用这一机会发送带有“你想阅读维基解密的文件吗？点击这里。”的消息。一旦用户点击链接，它会将他们带到一个pdf文件，允许社会工程师通过Javascript搜索计算机，确定计算机上的Adobe阅读器版本，并为该版本启动他们的利用。受害者不在意pdf加载需要时间，因为他们期待着一个巨大的文件。然而，他们也不知道加载时间长的不是文件，而是社会工程师嵌入的恶意软件。

  zh: 社会工程中使用的诡计不断演变，因为各种获取信息的工具不断推出。这些工具专门设计用于在社交网络网站中收集信息。
- en: In 2011, a tool referred to as a Facebook profile dumper was developed by a
    group of security researchers who were based in Egypt.  The tool was created to
    educate users on how people can get scammed easily on Facebook.  This Java-based
    tool was released for general use.  It automates the hidden Facebook profile data,
    which is collected from users and only accessible to friends in a network of a
    user.   According to the developers, the tool enables a user to send friend requests
    to a number of Facebook profiles.  The moment the recipient accepts the friend
    request, the tool dumps all his/her information, friend list, and photos to a
    local folder.

  zh: 2011年，一群驻埃及的安全研究人员开发了一个被称为Facebook个人资料转储工具的工具。该工具旨在教育用户如何在Facebook上容易受骗。这个基于Java的工具被释放供一般使用。它自动化收集用户的隐藏Facebook个人资料，这些资料只能被用户网络中的朋友访问。根据开发者的说法，该工具使用户能够向多个Facebook个人资料发送好友请求。一旦接收者接受了好友请求，该工具就会将他/她的所有信息、好友列表和照片转储到本地文件夹。
- en: The developers claimed that a scammer or social engineer collects information
    from the Facebook profile of a user simply by creating a new account.  The social
    engineer then adds all the user's friends through a “friending plugin” to ensure
    they share some common friends with the user.

  zh: 开发者声称，一个骗子或社会工程师通过创建一个新帐户就能从用户的Facebook个人资料中收集信息。然后，社会工程师通过“好友插件”添加所有用户的朋友，以确保他们与用户有一些共同的朋友。
- en: Then, the social engineer uses a cloning plugin that allows them to choose one
    of the user's friends.  The plugin clones the display name and picture of the
    chosen friend and lays it to the authenticated account.

  zh: 然后，社会工程师使用一个克隆插件，允许他们选择用户的一个朋友。该插件克隆所选朋友的显示名称和图片，并将其放置到经过认证的帐户中。
- en: The social engineer then sends a friend request to the user's account and once
    the latter accepts it, the tool begins to save all information, tags, images,
    and accessible HTML pages, allowing the attacker to examine them offline.  While
    it may be too late, the user may unfriend the forged account in the event that
    he or she discovers that it is actually fake.

  zh: 社会工程师随后向用户的账户发送了好友请求，一旦用户接受了，该工具就开始保存所有信息、标签、图片和可访问的 HTML 页面，使攻击者能够离线检查它们。尽管可能为时已晚，但用户在发现实际上是假的情况下可能会取消对伪造账户的好友请求。
- en: Given that the social engineer was able to penetrate into the user's information,
    they will be able to carry out a number of social engineering ploys.  When social
    engineers are able to obtain more personal information, they are likely to carry
    out more convincing ploys.  For instance, a target is likely inclined to open
    a malicious email attachment, which social engineers normally use in a spear-phishing
    attempt, if it seems to appear authentic.

  zh: 鉴于社会工程师能够侵入用户的信息，他们将能够进行一系列社会工程策略。当社会工程师能够获取更多个人信息时，他们很可能会执行更具说服力的策略。例如，如果目标看起来似乎是真实的，他们很可能会倾向于打开恶意的电子邮件附件，这是社会工程师通常在针对特定目标的网络钓鱼攻击中使用的。
- en: The main goal of the tool's developers for releasing it is user awareness for
    what is transpiring in the world, specifically in social networks.  The developers
    claimed that the tool will provide people awareness and be cautious of the actions
    they make online.  For instance, accepting friend requests without verifying the
    authenticity of the profile is one of the wrong actions people make.  Social engineers
    will be able to exploit user profiles even with the shortest period given.

  zh: 该工具开发人员发布它的主要目标是让人们意识到在社交网络中发生的事情，特别是关于世界上正在发生的事情。开发人员声称，该工具将提醒人们并谨慎对待他们在网上的行为。例如，接受好友请求而不验证个人资料的真实性是人们犯下的错误行为之一。即使给出了最短的时间，社会工程师也能够利用用户资料。
- en: The developers also hope that they can make people aware of the flawed user
    verification process of Facebook.  They claim that it is advisable for Facebook
    to have stricter policies when it comes to verifying profiles who claim to be
    “friends” as well as filter out impersonating or fake accounts.

  zh: 开发人员还希望他们能让人们意识到 Facebook 的用户验证过程存在缺陷。他们声称，建议 Facebook 在验证声称是“好友”的个人资料时采取更严格的政策，并过滤出冒充或虚假账户。
