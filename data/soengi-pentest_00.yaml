- en: I can still remember clearly when I sat down and started writing the framework
    at [social-engineer.org](http://www.social-engineer.org). I searched the Internet
    for helpful hints on topics I wanted to cover. Nevertheless, Social Engineering
    was not a hot topic at that time.

  zh: 我依然清晰地记得当我坐下来开始在[social-engineer.org](http://www.social-engineer.org)写框架时的情景。我在互联网上搜索我想要涵盖的主题的有用提示。然而，社会工程当时并不是一个热门话题。
- en: I could find videos on getting free food from drive thru’s or picking up girls…
    but nothing to do with security. Around the same time I was writing the framework,
    I worked hard to try and include social engineering in any security work I was
    doing. Most of the time companies would say things like, “Why try? We know we
    will fail.” or “There is no way anything like that would work on me!”

  zh: 我可以找到关于从驶入式快餐店获得免费食物或者追求女孩的视频……但没有关于安全的。在我写框架的同时，我努力尝试在我所做的任何安全工作中包含社会工程。大多数时候，公司会说：“为什么要尝试呢？我们知道我们会失败。”或者“像那样的事情绝不可能对我起作用！”
- en: I even resorted to giving away the services at times, just to prove how dangerous
    social engineering was. Fast forward now years into the future, people are emailing
    and calling for quotes on social engineering work every day. With the increase
    in interest comes the increase in “providers” of these services.

  zh: 我甚至曾经不惜免费提供服务，只是为了证明社会工程是多么危险。现在几年过去了，人们每天都在通过电子邮件和电话询价社会工程工作。随着兴趣的增加，这些服务的提供者也在增加。
- en: Unfortunately, for you, the readers of this book, there are so many providers
    it must be mind numbing to try and chose the right one. You may have asked yourself
    questions like “How do I know I am working with a good provider of SE Services?”
    “What is a social engineering pentest really?” and many more questions.

  zh: 不幸的是，对于你们这本书的读者来说，提供者实在是太多了，尝试选择正确的一个肯定会让人头昏脑涨。你可能会问自己一些问题，比如“我怎么知道我正在与一个好的社会工程服务提供商合作？”“社会工程渗透测试到底是什么？”以及许多其他问题。
- en: When I was approached about writing the foreword for this book, I was pretty
    strict about slapping a foreword inside these pages, until I read the book and
    understood what message these guys were trying to send. I had a few phone meetings
    to discuss their thoughts on topics and then I received the early editions of
    their writing.

  zh: 当有人找我写这本书的前言时，我本来是非常严肃的，对于在这些页面中加入前言我持有保留态度，直到我读了这本书并理解了这些人想传达的信息。我进行了几次电话会议，讨论了他们对话题的看法，然后我收到了他们的初稿。
- en: As I read through each chapter, I felt like I found a group of guys who “got
    it.” They made it clear what a social engineering pentest is, what questions you
    should ask, and how you can make the best of the budget you have to include this
    very important aspect into your yearly checkups.

  zh: 当我阅读每一章时，我感觉自己找到了一群“懂的人”。他们清楚地解释了社会工程渗透测试是什么，你应该问什么问题，以及你如何充分利用你的预算将这个非常重要的方面纳入你的年度检查中。
- en: Years later, here I am still offering social engineering services. I used to
    be one of the few, now one of the many but a book like this will help you find
    those of us that really know, understand, and ARE social engineering professionals.

  zh: 几年后，我仍在提供社会工程服务。我曾经是为数不多的人之一，现在是众多之一，但像这样的书籍会帮助你找到那些真正了解并且是社会工程专业人士的人。
- en: I know you will enjoy this book. For your business folks out there, you will
    especially enjoy [Chapter 5](CHP005.xhtml). It will help you understand then relate
    why it is important to engage a social engineer for your security needs.

  zh: 我知道你会喜欢这本书。对于那些企业人士来说，你们会特别喜欢[第五章](CHP005.xhtml)。它将帮助你理解并了解为什么为了你的安全需求要聘请一名社会工程师是很重要的。

    coverage of a very difficult topic that I know any ardent student of social engineering
    will want to study.

- en: I truly appreciate the chance I have had to read the work of Gavin, Andrew,
    and Richard. They have been open to my advice, more than patient with my busy
    schedule but most importantly they care about security. They don’t preach “stupid
    users” but they preach “uneducated users,” that is a message I hold close to my
    heart. My motto from day 1 has been “Security through education.” It is nice to
    find a group, like the authors of this book, that think the same way.

  zh: 我真诚地感谢我有机会阅读加文，安德鲁和理查德的作品。 他们乐于接受我的建议，对我的繁忙日程非常耐心，但最重要的是，他们关心安全。 他们不是在说“愚蠢的用户”，而是在说“未受教育的用户”，这是我非常重视的信息。
    我的座右铭从第一天开始就是“通过教育来确保安全。” 能够找到一个像这本书的作者团队一样思考的群体真是太好了。
