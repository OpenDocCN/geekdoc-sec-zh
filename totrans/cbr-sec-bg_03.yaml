    adopting new technologies were outweighed by the benefits and/or earnings they
    returned.  Even government agencies were caught being complacent about their security
    posture.  Now they are not being as complacent, but they are still being caught
    out.

    but still inside their realm of accountability.  As we covered in the last chapter,
    the flow of information through and onto digital devices is similar to the flow
    of water through a plumbing system.

    attaching their plumbing systems to a lot of other plumbing systems that they
    did not directly maintain and that they often had not checked for security weaknesses.

    to each enterprise’s operations, information no longer remained in a closed and
    controlled environment.

    whenever I am tasked with auditing a new environment, I look at where the information
    flows to identify what needs to be audited.  Not just the devices and their paths;
    also the human processes involved in building, delivering, managing and using
    these devices.

    2013, when Target (the US retailer) discovered that a copy of over 40 million
    customer details, including credit card numbers, had been stolen.  This shift
    was further compounded in 2014 when Home Depot (another major US retailer) fell
    victim to a very similar event.

    corporate damage impact that some cybersecurity experts had long predicted.

    also occurred in 2013, when a rogue contractor named Edward Snowden disclosed
    the contents of over a million classified documents.  During the time Snowden
    procured these documents, he did not work directly for the NSA; he worked for
    a sub-contractor.  We will look at that case study later on.

    from an organization that has suffered a major, well-publicized, breach is likely
    to be more aware of cybersecurity risks and countermeasures than a counterpart
    in a company that has never been hit.

    the future, once they have assessed and addressed their vulnerabilities. Until
    2014, most enterprises only invested reactively, after they fell victim to one
    or more major incidents.  But that has changed as a result of these events.

    throughout the world and demonstrate a good mix of the potential causes of damage
    that arises from having unidentified and/or unmitigated risks.  The individual
    root causes often seem to pose minor risks when looked at in isolation, but when
    a few of these individual risks are joined together in a line, they have the power
    to severely damage an organization.

    case studies we will look at, you will see that a number of what are referred
    to as ‘control failures’ existed and compounded each other to cause the breaches. 
    I call this a ‘stacked control failure’ as a result of unmitigated ‘stacked risks’
    and have dedicated a chapter to it later in the book.

    May 2016, and then Yahoo, continue to demonstrate that the largest compromises
    stem from multiple gaps in the security defenses.  It is difficult to sneak away
    with several hundred million readily decryptable passwords if all of your security
    controls are adequate.

    the theft or through destroying the victim’s property.

    interested in their own profit and costs.  The only time they are interested in
    your costs is when they are intentionally aiming to create high costs for you
    in order to perform some kind of ransom or extortion.

    breach, our first case study.  What happens when a known or suspected cybersecurity
    breach is detected?

    place, a largely manual process known as an incident response should begin.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '| incident response – a prepared set of processes that should be triggered
    when any known or suspected event takes place that could cause material damage
    to an organization.  The typical stages are (i) verify the event is real and identify
    the affected areas, (ii) contain the problem (usually by isolating, disabling
    or disconnecting the affected pieces), (iii) understand and eradicate the root
    cause, (iv) restore the affected components to their fixed state and (v) review
    how the process went to identify improvements that should be made.  An incident
    response may also be required to trigger other response procedures, such as a
    breach notification procedure, if any information has been lost that is subject
    to a notification requirement.  For example – the loss of any personal information
    beyond what might be found in a phone book entry is usually considered a notifiable
    event.breach notification procedure* – some types of information, when suspected
    or known to be lost or stolen, must, by law, be reported to one or more authorities
    within a defined time period.  The required notification time period varies by
    regulator, but is often within 24 hours.  In addition to reporting the known or
    suspected loss, the lead organization responsible for the information (referred
    to as the data owner) is also required to swiftly notify those affected, and later
    on, to submit a full root cause analysis and information about how they have responded
    and fixed the issues. To meet these legal obligations, larger companies usually
    have a pre-defined breach notification procedure to ensure that the timelines
    are met.  The fines for data breaches are usually increased or decreased based
    on the adequacy of the organization’s breach and incident response management.
