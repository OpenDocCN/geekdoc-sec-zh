- en: As mentioned in the previous chapters of this book, some of the most common
    places for social engineering ploys include corporate offices, social networking
    sites, and just about anywhere on the Web.  Social engineers are able to infiltrate
    corporate systems, hijack accounts, steal identities, and make money through employing
    different tactics, including the formulation of good pickup lines.

    social engineers and their targets.  Some of the most effective pickup lines used
    in social engineering will be discussed in the following section as well as how
    they work.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This pickup line works when a social engineer pretends to be a Facebook “friend”
    or a contact in other social networks.  He or she sends a message to the target
    pretending to be in a foreign city and has no money due to lost wallet, robbery,
    or other unfortunate event.  The social engineer then asks the target to wire
    money.

- en: In this type of pickup line, people should be extra careful because most social
    engineers are able to hack accounts and pose as one of a target's contacts or
    friends.  Thus, people cannot be guaranteed that the identities of those they
    are in contact with, specifically in social networks are genuine.

- en: This pickup line works when a social engineer sends a message or an email and
    encourages the target to click a link, which leads to a bogus site.  The social
    engineer usually poses as a friend so that the target would likely read the message. 
    Once the target clicks on the link, the bogus website, which may appear legitimate,
    asks the target for personal information such as account number or password.

    with a pickup line, “Have you seen this video of you?”  A number of people with
    Twitter accounts fell for this line and led them to a fake Twitter website that
    required their passwords.

- en: This pickup line works, specifically in the numerous applications that users
    can download in Facebook and other social networking sites.  This is because not
    all applications available in Facebook are safe.  Social engineers administer
    and control applications that install adware for launching pop-up ads.  They also
    have applications in which personal information of targets are exposed to third
    parties.

- en: This pickup line works when a social engineer poses as a technical support person,
    calling a target from a certain business or company.  The social engineer tells
    the target that the computer is infected and offers to fix it.  Then, the social
    engineer ratchets the technical difficulty intentionally as he or she plays on
    the fear and vulnerability of the target.  As the target becomes more nervous,
    the social engineer takes advantage by letting the target reveal the password
    as “required” to finish the fix.

- en: This pickup line works when a social engineer poses as a client, service technician,
    or sales representative among others, making him/her a legitimate visitor.  The
    social engineer will then use his/her knowledge about the company he/she is representing. 
    Some social engineers even wear a shirt bearing the logo of the company.  This
    tactic is effective in gaining the confidence or trust of the receptionist.  Social
    engineers spend days, weeks, and even months to obtain adequate information about
    their targets.  They take time in knowing who to ask for as well as how to dress
    and act when already inside the company.

- en: This pickup line works when a social engineer waits outside the entryway of
    a company, usually the entry point of a smoking area or the front door.  The social
    engineer then poses as one of the employees.  More often than not, targets willingly
    hold the door open for social engineers in disguise.  Thus, the attackers are
    able to access the building without being asked for their identities.  Furthermore,
    social engineers get better when it comes to using high-end photography, specifically
    for printing genuine-looking badges.  As such, even when asked for credentials,
    social engineers simply present their self-made, fake badges.

- en: This pickup line works when a social engineer sends a target an email that may
    seem to originate from prominent companies and organizations like eBay.  The message
    tells the target that he or she won a bid and have not yet paid for the item. 
    Social engineers know that targets who are into websites such as eBay give importance
    to their ratings and not being able to pay for a won item would result in a negative
    impact.  As such, they are likely to click the link while the social engineer
    obtains the personal information of the target.

    and economic uncertainty.  The social engineer sends an email to the target containing
    a malicious link, which may appear as legitimate.  The link may be supported by
    another pickup line such as “This year, we are sending out W-2 forms electronically. 
    Click here.”

    inclined to targeting individual people for a larger payoff.  There are more lucrative
    pickup lines that social engineers use to gain personal information of their targets
    and make more money.

- en: This pickup line usually starts circulating shortly after a tsunami, major earthquake,
    or other disaster.  Fake websites that social engineers manage target people who
    are deeply concerned about their loved ones in the disaster area.  The website
    usually claims to have rescue efforts and other specialized resources to help
    in finding victims and their recovery.  In order to solicit charitable donations,
    the website collects the names as well as contact information of those who are
    willing to donate.  The social engineer then calls the victim who naturally has
    heightened emotions to obtain their account or credit card number.  Thus, the
    social engineer would be equipped to commit identity theft with all the information
    obtained such as the target's name, address, account or credit card number, and
    a relative's name among others.  Some social engineers even conduct a secondary
    attack by posing as a bank representative who requests for the Social Security
    number of the victim for the purpose of verifying the legitimacy of the donation.

    individual.  The social engineer claims to be notifying all licensed Windows users
    who are experiencing abnormal number of errors caused by a software bug.  The
    target is instructed to access the event log, which is usually alarming for inexperienced
    users.  More often than not, Windows event logs are able to record numerous yet
    small errors.  The target is likely to do whatever is instructed of him by the
    social engineer, prompting to go to a remote access service, such as Teamviewer.com. 
    This service provides the social engineer control over the target's PC.  Then,
    the social engineer installs malware, which will provide him/her continuous access
    to the target's PC.

- en: This is one of the most common phishing lures used in social engineering.  Attackers
    continuously observe the trends in Twitter in order to carry out their ploys. 
    For instance, social engineers hijack legitimate hashtags to embed malicious links. 
    Once the targets tweeted using the hashtags, the malware redirects them to a phishing
    site with the intent of launching more malware or stealing the targets' account
    information in Twitter.  More often than not, social engineers look for targets
    in Twitter by learning about their interests.  Then, the attackers send tweets
    that appear legitimate to entice targets to click the links that lead to phishing
    sites.

    targets an increase in their followers once they click a link.  The link then
    leads the targets to a web service, which asks for their credentials in Twitter. 
    For those who are knowledgeable, there is not legitimate third party that would
    request for Twitter credentials.

    by embedding malware in their email responses to numerous job postings.  Based
    on a warning released by the FBI, over $150,000 was stolen from a prominent business
    due to unauthorized wire transfer.  The social engineer responds to a job posting
    on a specific employment website.  Once the malware is installed, the social engineer
    obtains the target's credentials, specifically for online banking in order to
    carry out financial transactions within the company.  The social engineer redirects
    the wire transfers to his/her own accounts through making changes in the account
    settings.  As this tactic became rampant, most companies and organizations use
    online forms for job seekers instead of accepting their cover letters and resumes
    in email attachments.
