  zh: 现在考虑“自带设备上班”（BYOD）的趋势。这是一种常见的政策，公司允许员工从任何地方购买任何手机或平板电脑，然后将其用于与公司相关的工作，可能包括公司电子邮件。如何确保安全？如果你口袋里真的很大，有方法可以减轻这种危险，但毫无疑问，相关的安全成本开始超过设备的价值和便利性。因此，许多最初采用BYOD的公司已经开始限制可用于处理公司信息的设备范围和配置。
- en: Regardless of the potential threats, many companies do allow employees and some
    contractors to use their own personal equipment inside their network and/or to
    access privileged or sensitive information.  It is no coincidence that the uptake
    of BYOD tends to be higher in poorer countries with more relaxed attitudes towards
    the safety of company information.

    opportunities, even by major global companies, has sometimes been astoundingly
    short-sighted. In simple terms, the immediate business value of a technology or

- en: For example – the business case benefit for BYOD is often presented as the perception
    that having employees purchase their own devices saves the company money and increases
    employee productivity because many employees seem to be more comfortable using
    their own devices for both personal and work-related tasks.  On the other side
    of the equation, there are billions of combinations of free applications and software
    that can be loaded onto peoples’ personal devices.  This means there are more
    vulnerability combinations (vectors again) than can possibly be considered or
    mitigated.

    completely different system than the flight controls do.  The only possible connection

    Autopilot (BHUAP).  It is essentially an anti-hijack system that can remove all
    power and control from the flight deck, with the aircraft still able to operate
    and fly. Its patent can be found in public records.

    flight parameters, the system can essentially transfer control of the plane from
    the pilots and defer to either a pre-programmed emergency flight plan, or it can
    open a radio frequency link through a piece of standard aircraft equipment called
    a 'Mode S Transponder' to accept remote flight management.
