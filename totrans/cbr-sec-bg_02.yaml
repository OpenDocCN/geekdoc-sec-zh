    that having employees purchase their own devices saves the company money and increases
    employee productivity because many employees seem to be more comfortable using
    their own devices for both personal and work-related tasks.  On the other side
    of the equation, there are billions of combinations of free applications and software
    that can be loaded onto peoples’ personal devices.  This means there are more
