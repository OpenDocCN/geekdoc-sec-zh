- en: Over the past several years, a number of industries have been targeted in attacks
    seeking to steal intellectual property from large multinational companies, nonprofits,
    and governments. Some of these attacks have targeted everything from large defense
    firms to small law firms. These targeted attacks often leverage spear phishing
    for the initial breach. The attackers then use the footholds gained in the initial
    attack to further penetrate the organization to steal privilege and confidential
    data and intellectual property. Attackers are better funded and better staffed
    than more of the organizations being targeted, and they are getting around traditional
    network defenses like firewall and antivirus by using spear phishing and other
    social engineering attacks. The best defense against spear phishing and other
    social engineering attacks is a security awareness program.

- en: Most attacks are targeted. They are targeted by either application, port, platform,
    occupation, or industry. When building an information security awareness program,
    it is important to include information and examples that are specific to your
    organization. If your organization is a law firm, point out how bad guys are targeting
    law firms and lawyers. If your organization is a nonprofit, give examples of how
    bad guys have targeted nonprofits in the past. These examples go a long way in
    destroying the myth of “no one wants our stuff.”

- en: Attackers target users by targeting applications and services users use daily
    to do their work and that users use for fun such as social networking. One way
    attackers target users is through e-mail. Spear phishing attacks take the form
    of e-mail targeted to a specific user or group of users in enticing the user to
    click on links contained in the e-mail or to open attachments sent with the e-mail.
    The first step in crafting a spear phishing e-mail is for the attackers to research
    their target using your organization's website, social media sites, and other
    open-source information from online public websites and directories. Once the
    attackers figure out what the interests of the targeted users are, they will use
    those interests to build targeted e-mail.

- en: For example, if a targeted user, in this case let's say it's the CEO of an organization,
    says they are interested in stamp collecting, the attacker will send the targeted
    user a phishing e-mail about stamp collecting that contains a link or an attachment
    that will allow the attacker to take control of the targeted user's computer.
    Once the CEO's computer has been exploited using this method, the attacker will
    then turn their attention to pivoting the attack to penetrate and exploit the
    rest of the network and to steal data.

- en: Attackers recently have begun to target industries related to defense and government
    contracting. In 2011, RSA, who provides two-factor authentication tokens, called
    SecurID, to the US government and US government contractors, uncovered a breach
    of the database that transmits and stores the tokens. During the same period,
    defense contractors Raytheon, General Dynamics, and L-3 Communications also reported
    breaches. Some in the industry linked the RSA breach to the other breaches [[1](#bb0010)].
    While some continue to debate if the breaches are somehow linked, they are examples
    of targeted attacks. Defense contractors hold valuable information from the design
    of the latest fighter/bomber designs to nuclear research. They definitely hold
    data that would be valuable to hackers, spies, and other governments.

    being targeted in phishing attacks. The phishing e-mails contained “zip,” “jpeg,”
    or other safe-looking attachments that when opened attempt to download and execute
    the file “srhost.exe” from the domain [http://d.ueopen.com](http://d.ueopen.com).
    “Law firms have a tremendous concentration of really critical, private information,”
    Bradford Bleier, unit chief in the cyber division of the FBI, told The Associated
    Press. Infiltrating those computer systems “is a really optimal way to obtain
    economic, personal and personal security related information” [[2](#bb0015)].

    in New York City in the fall of 2011 to engage firms on threat and a rising number

    law firms. As previously reported, scammers send e-mails to lawyers, claiming
    to be overseas and seeking legal representation to collect delinquent payments
    from third parties in the U.S. The law firm receives a retainer agreement, invoices
    reflecting the amount owed, and a check payable to the law firm. The firm is instructed
    to extract the retainer fee, including any other fees associated with the transaction,
    and wire the remaining funds to banks in Korea, China, Ireland, or Canada. By
    the time the check is determined to be counterfeit, the funds have already been
    wired overseas.

    check for the settlement via delivery service. The ex-wife instructs the firm
    to wire the funds, less the retainer fee, to an overseas bank account. When the

    interest to attackers, and attackers will use any means possible to get to that
    information. Smaller breaches go unreported because the organization does not
    know they have been breached or they don’t want to admit to business partners
    and customers that they have lost data. The goal of state breach notification
    laws was to address the part of the problem of underreporting. Just because your
    organization might be small or midsized doesn’t mean that you don’t have information
    of value. In fact, like most organizations, it is likely that your security program
    is underbudgeted and understaffed while attackers are well funded and fully staffed
    by highly trained staff. You are being targeted. Implementing a security awareness
    program is your best defense against these well-funded, determined attackers.
