  zh: 摘要
- en: Not every organization is the same. As a result, there are a wide variety of
    experiences when people start building their own information security awareness
    programs. In this chapter, we ask those in the trenches about their experience
    in building information security awareness programs in their own organizations.

    There has to be some reason for the individual to “buy in” and this usually goes
    beyond work. Correlating security issues to the user''s daily lives will put the
    risk into terms that they understand and help them to realize how all facets of
    our technical lives intertwine with many parts of our physical lives inadvertently.

- en: I keep a large bulletin board in each facility that is devoted to security awareness
    education. I will sit down each New Year and pick twelve topics I want to cover
    that year and figure out a theme to tie to each. I will create an e-mail signature
    that ties into that topic and then post a print out of a small short deck I created
    on the bulletin board. It's usually only nice slides because that's what I can
    fit on my board, three across and three down. Sometimes, I will go by the party
    store and get rolls of wrapping paper or those inexpensive cardboard cutouts to
    spiff the board up or catch everyone's attention. If you are thinking to yourself
    that this sounds suspiciously like those bulletin boards they had in each classroom
    in elementary school, you would be CORRECT! That is, the idea only geared toward
    a more adult audience!

    I know my folks are really interested in something, I will try to bring someone
    in for that topic. One year, I managed to arrange to bring in a polygraph examiner
    from a local agency and he spent almost two hours explaining the process and equipment
    in detail and then hooked various people up and taught the entire audience how
    to read the results along with him. It was an absolutely standing room only but
    many people came to the briefing prior to that or staid for the one after that

    who is still a bit overwhelmed by Facebook (like my mom) and something that simple
    doesn't even occur to them. Many people are pretty decent folks at heart and don't
    think like an adversary or bad guy so it's just foreign to them to think someone
    will steal from them or use their systems to do bad things. There is no need to
    terrify them into submission but this is something you have to keep in mind as
    you are educating them on how to keep themselves and the enterprise safe. Don't
    just tell them what to do, tell them WHY to do it and what could happen if they
    don't. Then, reinforce that with stories and case studies to make it REAL to them

- en: 'A: The key point for an information security awareness program is to get the
    regular employee to be your first line of defense for the information security
    program. In other words, they need to be aware that their actions (or inactions)
    can lead to breaches of data and the security of the company. Hence, they need
    to understand that their role is the everyday eyes and ears for the company''s
    security.'

- en: 'A: I have held the equivalent of four CISO positions—each one was the first
    true information security manager for each of the companies. Hence, the security
    program I needed to enact was truly a start-up for each company. One area that
    I included in each of the companies was a security awareness program of one sort
    or another.'

    of the company's defense for InfoSec. Hence, they need to understand their roles
    and they need to understand what to do if they see a problem that could be indicative
    of an InfoSec issue in progress.

- en: 'A: The management buy-in was relatively easy since the management wanted a
    security awareness program anyway. The management caused some challenges when
    they were concerned that InfoSec became a “police function,” and then in one company,
    the management was very strong in stopping the program until it was modified (e.g.,
    putting notes on chairs if an unattended desktop was unlocked was viewed as being
    too much a “police function” and needed to stop).'

    the time it took to develop the presentations, etc. That was the biggest issue
    since all four security awareness programs were built along the concept of “guerilla
    marketing”—basically quick, cheap, and effective. This detracted from me doing
    my other roles.'

    program. But I could get some funds for small things like simple handouts and
    posters, designed and made by me. But, purchasing any security awareness products
    on the outside was not allowed for the programs due to the lack of funds.'

    good security practices back into the office space.
