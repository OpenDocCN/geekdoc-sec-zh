    experiences when people start building their own information security awareness
    programs. In this chapter, we ask those in the trenches about their experience
    in building information security awareness programs in their own organizations.

- en: 'A: In order for a security awareness plan to work, it has to engage the employees.
    There has to be some reason for the individual to “buy in” and this usually goes
    beyond work. Correlating security issues to the user''s daily lives will put the
    risk into terms that they understand and help them to realize how all facets of
    our technical lives intertwine with many parts of our physical lives inadvertently.
    Encouraging the people to police themselves (and each other) and to reward those
    who speak out when things aren''t right will help change the culture from one
    of complacent silence to one of engaged interaction.'

    attackers leverage devastating attacks on the human element within an organization
    by understanding psychology then using normal human behavior and societal norms

    with technical attacks, and an endless combination of the two, the organization
    finds itself fighting a constant uphill battle where they must be “right” every

    by the decision makers until after it''s too late. Part of the awareness program
    has to be testing our users. Oftentimes, that has to be the first component and
    has to be leveraged before any plans are formalized because it provides metrics

    that employ different techniques so the people can experience different flavors
    and find what suits them. I''ve also seen several styles wrapped into one where
    the audience listened, spoke, read, and participated in various segments throughout

    $1000 worth of prizes for our awards. This money was split up into different denomination

    to do something and almost 100% of my staff refused to do it until I confirmed
    that his e-mail was legitimate and it was not a “trick.” I had just one week before
    that I told them about how it was possible for people to hack the e-mail accounts
    of a senior leader or send e-mails that look like they come from important internal
    departments. I actually had a project manager tell his entire team to hold until
    he had cleared it with me. While this was incredibly annoying to have to deal
    with several hundred frantics and worried phone calls and e-mails over the next
    24 h, it was also pretty awesome to see how many people had paid attention and
    forwarded his e-mail to me with words to the effect of, “I remember that stuff
    you told us and I am not going to do this unless YOU say it's okay!”

    I needed. I had just recently done a briefing on social engineering and part of
    me wondered if they would even question it but so often you feel like no one is
    listening to you so I didn't think much of it. I had to smile when they replied
    with a “test” saying they'd be happy to get that information to me but they wanted
    to make sure I was who I said I was so would I please tell them my son's name.
    I don't have a son, I have a daughter so I smiled and replied to them with the
    correct information and ALSO corrected another comment they had made about my
    boyfriend who was overseas at the time as they knew where he was but had deliberately
    asked how he was enjoying his stay in a completely different country. They apologized
    for “questioning” me, as many senior leadership types often get angry if challenged
    or questioned but I praised the fact they paid attention and stopped to question
    my request. I have had many more instances like this and I feel that reporting
    metric is what truly shows how effective my program has been.

    to read the results along with him. It was an absolutely standing room only but

    802.11 wireless presents to organizations. This was while I was part of the Regional
    Computer Emergency Response Team (RCERT)–Europe in Mannheim, Germany. We made
    the video using a van parked in a Walmart parking lot with a large antenna aimed
    several hundred feet away at an office building just inside the perimeter fence
    of the Army installation. The video showed us wardriving at first, detecting the
    access point, and then parking to exploit a server via the wireless network.

    humans, we placed 4 ft inflatable aliens within the video. One rode shotgun in
    the passenger seat of the van, one stood by the antenna in the parking lot, and
    other looked on as the server was exploited. While this video was intended to
    US Army personnel in Europe, it made the rounds all over Army installations worldwide.
    It was even adopted by the Army Signal School at Fort Gordon. Even though the
    video was totally staged and no Army network was ever in any danger, the association
    of the aliens with the danger of wireless stuck in people's minds. The video was
    made in 2002, and years later, people still asked about the video once they knew
    I worked at the RCERT–Europe. Plus, now it is in this survey too!

    information security awareness programs?'

- en: 'A: Be creative! The program needs to go beyond just another annual training
    requirement. You are essentially marketing or selling this program to the intended
    audience; if you can''t gain their attention, you won''t accomplish much. If your
    organization has a sales department, use the talent within that department to
    come up with a marketing strategy. If you have a public relations personnel, ask
    them for advice to how to best reach your audience. Remember that many people
    won''t remember much of the Super Bowl game each year other than a few highlights
    of the game and those 30 s commercials—your program needs to have few key nuggets
    of InfoSec that people will remember!'

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'A: The key point for an information security awareness program is to get the
    regular employee to be your first line of defense for the information security
    program. In other words, they need to be aware that their actions (or inactions)
    can lead to breaches of data and the security of the company. Hence, they need
    to understand that their role is the everyday eyes and ears for the company''s
    security.'

- en: 'A: I have held the equivalent of four CISO positions—each one was the first
    true information security manager for each of the companies. Hence, the security
    program I needed to enact was truly a start-up for each company. One area that
    I included in each of the companies was a security awareness program of one sort
    or another.'
  prefs: []

- en: My reason for this was as noted above—I view each employee to be the first line
    of the company's defense for InfoSec. Hence, they need to understand their roles
    and they need to understand what to do if they see a problem that could be indicative
    of an InfoSec issue in progress.

    security awareness program anyway. The management caused some challenges when
    they were concerned that InfoSec became a “police function,” and then in one company,
    the management was very strong in stopping the program until it was modified (e.g.,
    putting notes on chairs if an unattended desktop was unlocked was viewed as being
    too much a “police function” and needed to stop).'

    since all four security awareness programs were built along the concept of “guerilla
    marketing”—basically quick, cheap, and effective. This detracted from me doing

    on the outside was not allowed for the programs due to the lack of funds.'
