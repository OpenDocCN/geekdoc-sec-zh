    in reality, they really don’t go well together at all unless you have a really
    smart ninja or a really deadly hacker, in which case we’re more talking about
    ninja hackers, which in an entirely different breed. Don’t even get me started
    about pirate ninja hackers. But I digress. Hackers and ninja both like wearing
    black, and they do share the ability to slip inside a building and blend with
    the shadows. They can also both do that smoke trick—the one that lets them pass
    through walls unscathed, engulfed by a cool-looking (but smelly) cloud of smoke.
    Impossible, you say? Hardly. Read on as I reveal yet another bit of pure, no-tech
    hacker (ninja) magic.

    riding on their coattails. When I suggested tailgating into a veritable fortress,
    Vince opted for the washcloth trick. His idea was better given the situation,
    but tailgating is still one of the best no-tech methods for gaining access to
    a secured building. Tailgating has become a household term, meaning it’s a common
    problem.

    facility. The facility was split into two distinct areas: an open area to accommodate
    the general public and a restricted area for state employees. We were tasked with
    entering the restricted area and gaining access to the closed computer network
    inside. Our initial reconnaissance revealed that the open and restricted areas
    were connected, but an armed guard stood watch over the connecting hallway. The
    front door to the secured area was similarly protected. Doors armed with swipe
    card readers (none of which appeared vulnerable to the washcloth trick) protected
    each of the side doors. To make matters worse for my team, armed guards in marked
    vehicles patrolled the parking lots.'

    and eventually hit pay dirt. Huddled around a side entrance to the secured area,
    we spotted a group of employees chatting away while having a smoke. I knew immediately
    we had found our way in. We headed to the nearest gas station where I bought a
    pack of cigarettes and a lighter.

    I wore cruddy jeans, work boots, and a white T-shirt with a phone company logo.
    I had a phone company employee badge clipped to my collar. My bright-yellow toolbox
    sported phone company logos and the clear top revealed a small stack of branded
    payphone info-strips. The toolbox was filled with phone test equipment. A battered
    hardhat completed the look.

    the phone company logo from the Internet. I printed the T-shirt myself using iron-on
    transfer paper. I printed the badge on my home printer and laminated it with a
    $2 kit. The payphone strips were liberated from some local payphones. The phone
    test gear was legitimate, collected from various sources for just such an occasion.
    I found the hardhat abandoned on the side of the road. Its battered condition
    made it more convincing.

    good an actor I turned out to be. If they watched me approach from the parking
    lot, they would consider me an outsider. If instead they came out of the building
    and found me already there, halfway through a smoke, they might assume I had come
    *out* of the building for a break.

    lit up a cigarette. Two employees eventually came out and began talking between
    themselves. I nodded casually and joined in their small talk. They chattered about
    company politics and I nodded at appropriate moments, making sure to blow smoke
    up into the air every now and then to convince them of my familiarity with cigarettes.
    I grunted about how the phone system had been acting up lately. They laughed and
    agreed (lucky for me) and I tried not to gag on the cigarette, wondering the whole
    time if I was turning as green as I felt. As they put out their smokes, they swiped
    their badges to return inside. I flicked my cigarette into the road—which is a
    corporate smoker faux pas–and held the door open for them. They thanked me for
    the kind gesture and I filed in behind them. Let me say that again. They *thanked
    me* for holding the door for them despite the fact that I had just broken into
    their building because of them. Once inside I had my way with the facility.

    even walked through the security office. The receptionist looked surprised to
    see me until I pointed to an empty desk and told her the phone was broken. She
    wasn’t sure whether the phone was broken or not but she let me in. After all,
    I was the phone guy. I plopped my toolbox on the desk, picked up the phone and
    heard a dial tone. I shook my head, put the phone back on the cradle and lifted
    my toolbox off the desk, along with a stack of important-looking papers. I left
    the office grumbling about stupid work orders and how they always give me the
    wrong jack number and how it always made me look like an idiot. The receptionist
    giggled and told me to come back any time. I think she liked me. It was probably
    the helmet.

    of simple, no-tech attacks. We left with piles of documents proving we had been
    inside, and my paperback-sized computer was loaded with hundreds of megabytes
    of sensitive State data. The employees never challenged me because they recognized
    the logo on my shirt and badge. Since the logos and the gear looked legit, I was
    probably who I appeared to be. But I had purposely played the role of a technician
    from the *wrong* phone company. The company I selected was a recognized data and
    voice service provider, but they didn’t provide local hardware support. In layman’s
    terms, even if I was an employee of that phone company, I had no business being
    in the facility, and even if I did, I wouldn’t have been testing phone handsets.

    of tailgating to gain initial access to the building and then threw in a healthy
    dose of social engineering to schmooze everyone I ran into inside the building.

    his picture, and turned to watch as I drove past. He probably made a mental note
    of my license plate number and called it in to the local phone technician stalker
    hotline. So much for stealth. Once I even stepped off the sidewalk into a row
    of bushes to snag a quality covert photo of an approaching delivery guy. The photo
    didn’t turn out, but at least I made a new friend. The delivery guy was nice enough
    to help me out of the prickly holly thicket.

    just *ask* my target for permission to snap a few photos. I ask politely (avoiding
    those stalker vibes) and most people are more than happy to oblige me. In some
    cases, I make up a story about my kid liking big trucks, and ask if my target
    would mind posing for a quick photo. After, all, who’s going to deny a little
    kid happiness? The delivery guy shown in the next (heavily blurred) photo was
    extremely accommodating. I got a photo of his truck, his outfit and even his employee
    badge—more than enough detail to pull together a convincing delivery-guy persona.

    wander around inside a target building dressed as a delivery guy, helping myself
    to sooper-secret documents, there’s a problem with my target’s security program.
    What it boils down to is that most folks take the world at face value. If an employee
    sees a familiar logo on a badge or a polo shirt, he or she will naturally assume
    I am who I appear to be. It’s socially awkward to confront an unfamiliar person,
    but as I’ve already said—it takes just one vigilant person to stop my team in
    its tracks.

    grumpy about stuff like that. Besides, he’ll be really grumpy if you jack his
    flow and he turns out to be legitimately plugging away at his underpaying job.
    On the other hand, if this guy has the stones to hack an ATM smack-dab in the
    middle of a busy hallway, he’s probably got no qualms about rattling off a bold-faced
    lie to get you to go away. If he’s got real skill, he’ll talk you out of *your*
    employee badge so he doesn’t get hassled anymore as he tries to protect *your*

    need to play vigilante. If you think something’s up, tell someone who gets paid
    to care. Security guards, police officers, air marshals, mirror-shaded Secret
    Service agents and school crossing guards all care very deeply about protecting
    those in their charge. And even if they don’t care about protecting anything but
    themselves, most of them enjoy the paycheck their work produces. So the odds are
    pretty good that if you tell them about a potential security threat, they’ll either
    do something about it or get fired when that particular bad guy ends up robbing
    the place blind. Either way, it’s better to allow them the opportunity to do their
    job rather than play full-time hall monitor. I’m sure you have better things to
