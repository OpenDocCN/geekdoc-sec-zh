- en: Hackers and Ninja go together like … smart people and stealthy assassins. OK,
    in reality, they really don’t go well together at all unless you have a really
    smart ninja or a really deadly hacker, in which case we’re more talking about
    ninja hackers, which in an entirely different breed. Don’t even get me started
    about pirate ninja hackers. But I digress. Hackers and ninja both like wearing
    black, and they do share the ability to slip inside a building and blend with
    the shadows. They can also both do that smoke trick—the one that lets them pass
    through walls unscathed, engulfed by a cool-looking (but smelly) cloud of smoke.
    Impossible, you say? Hardly. Read on as I reveal yet another bit of pure, no-tech
    hacker (ninja) magic.

  zh: 黑客和忍者像……聪明人和隐秘刺客一样。好吧，事实上，他们根本不太搭配，除非你有一个非常聪明的忍者或一个非常致命的黑客，在这种情况下，我们更多地谈论的是黑客忍者，这是一种完全不同的品种。甚至不要让我开始谈论海盗忍者黑客。但我岔开了话题。黑客和忍者都喜欢穿黑色，并且他们都有能力悄悄进入建筑物并与阴影融为一体。他们还都能做到那个烟雾伎俩——让他们毫发无损地穿过墙壁，被一个看起来很酷（但发臭）的烟雾团包围。不可能吗？几乎不可能。继续阅读，我将揭示另一种纯粹的、无技术的黑客（忍者）魔法。

  zh: 跟随行为简介
- en: Tailgating simply means following an authorized person into a building—basically,
    riding on their coattails. When I suggested tailgating into a veritable fortress,
    Vince opted for the washcloth trick. His idea was better given the situation,
    but tailgating is still one of the best no-tech methods for gaining access to
    a secured building. Tailgating has become a household term, meaning it’s a common
    problem.

  zh: 跟随授权人员进入建筑物简单地意味着——基本上是靠他们的余波行事。当我建议跟随一位授权人员进入一个实际上是堡垒的建筑物时，文斯选择了湿毛巾伎俩。考虑到情况，他的想法更好，但跟随行为仍然是获得进入安全建筑的最佳无技术方法之一。跟随行为已成为一个家喻户晓的术语，这意味着这是一个普遍存在的问题。
- en: 'Years ago, I was tasked with a physical assessment against a state government
    facility. The facility was split into two distinct areas: an open area to accommodate
    the general public and a restricted area for state employees. We were tasked with
    entering the restricted area and gaining access to the closed computer network
    inside. Our initial reconnaissance revealed that the open and restricted areas
    were connected, but an armed guard stood watch over the connecting hallway. The
    front door to the secured area was similarly protected. Doors armed with swipe
    card readers (none of which appeared vulnerable to the washcloth trick) protected
    each of the side doors. To make matters worse for my team, armed guards in marked
    vehicles patrolled the parking lots.'

  zh: 多年前，我被派去对一个州政府设施进行身体评估。该设施分为两个明显的区域：一个开放区域供一般公众使用，一个限制区域供州政府雇员使用。我们的任务是进入限制区域，并获得内部封闭计算机网络的访问权限。我们的初步侦察显示，开放区域和限制区域相连，但一名武装警卫守在连接走廊上。进入安全区域的前门同样受到保护。每个侧门都有装有刷卡读卡器的门（其中没有一个看起来容易受到湿毛巾伎俩的影响）。更糟糕的是，装备有武装警卫的标记车辆在停车场巡逻。
- en: Although at first discouraged by the heavy security, we kept up our surveillance
    and eventually hit pay dirt. Huddled around a side entrance to the secured area,
    we spotted a group of employees chatting away while having a smoke. I knew immediately
    we had found our way in. We headed to the nearest gas station where I bought a
    pack of cigarettes and a lighter.

- en: I had come prepared to social engineer my way into the building as a phone technician.^([1](#ft1))
    I wore cruddy jeans, work boots, and a white T-shirt with a phone company logo.
    I had a phone company employee badge clipped to my collar. My bright-yellow toolbox
    sported phone company logos and the clear top revealed a small stack of branded
    payphone info-strips. The toolbox was filled with phone test equipment. A battered
    hardhat completed the look.

  zh: 我准备好以一名电话技术员的身份社会工程学地进入建筑物。我穿着破烂的牛仔裤、工作靴和一件带有电话公司标志的白色T恤。我夹在领口上的是电话公司的员工徽章。我的明黄色工具箱上有电话公司的标志，透明的顶部露出了一小堆品牌化的电话信息条。工具箱里装满了电话测试设备。一顶破旧的安全帽完成了这个造型。
- en: The official-looking getup was, of course, a complete fabrication. I downloaded
    the phone company logo from the Internet. I printed the T-shirt myself using iron-on
    transfer paper. I printed the badge on my home printer and laminated it with a
    $2 kit. The payphone strips were liberated from some local payphones. The phone
    test gear was legitimate, collected from various sources for just such an occasion.
    I found the hardhat abandoned on the side of the road. Its battered condition
    made it more convincing.

    good an actor I turned out to be. If they watched me approach from the parking
    lot, they would consider me an outsider. If instead they came out of the building

    *out* of the building for a break.

  zh: 不管我演技有多好，靠近吸烟者的群体都是个坏主意。如果他们从停车场看着我走过来，他们会认为我是局外人。如果他们从大楼出来发现我已经在那里，正在抽烟，他们可能会认为我已经*从*大楼出来休息了一会。
- en: After the group of smokers headed back inside, I hurried to the side door and
    lit up a cigarette. Two employees eventually came out and began talking between
    themselves. I nodded casually and joined in their small talk. They chattered about
    company politics and I nodded at appropriate moments, making sure to blow smoke
    up into the air every now and then to convince them of my familiarity with cigarettes.
    I grunted about how the phone system had been acting up lately. They laughed and
    agreed (lucky for me) and I tried not to gag on the cigarette, wondering the whole
    time if I was turning as green as I felt. As they put out their smokes, they swiped
    their badges to return inside. I flicked my cigarette into the road—which is a
    corporate smoker faux pas–and held the door open for them. They thanked me for
    the kind gesture and I filed in behind them. Let me say that again. They *thanked
    me* for holding the door for them despite the fact that I had just broken into
    their building because of them. Once inside I had my way with the facility.

  zh: 集体吸烟的人回到室内后，我赶紧走向侧门，点燃了一支香烟。两名员工最终出来了，开始在他们之间交谈。我随意地点点头，加入了他们的闲聊。他们谈论着公司政治，我在恰当的时候点头表示同意，并不时吐出烟雾，以确保他们相信我对香烟很熟悉。我抱怨电话系统最近一直出问题。他们笑了笑并表示同意（幸运的是），我尽量不要被香烟呛到，心里想着自己是否会因为感觉到的头晕而变得像我感觉的那样难受。当他们熄灭烟时，他们刷卡回到室内。我把烟掐在路边——这是企业吸烟者的失礼行为——并为他们拉开了门。他们感谢我这个友好的举动，我跟在他们后面进去了。再说一遍。他们*感谢我*为他们拉开门，尽管我刚因为他们的缘故闯入了他们的大楼。一旦进入室内，我就可以按照我的意愿行事了。
- en: I made my way through the building and was never challenged. At one point, I
    even walked through the security office. The receptionist looked surprised to
    see me until I pointed to an empty desk and told her the phone was broken. She
    wasn’t sure whether the phone was broken or not but she let me in. After all,
    I was the phone guy. I plopped my toolbox on the desk, picked up the phone and
    heard a dial tone. I shook my head, put the phone back on the cradle and lifted
    my toolbox off the desk, along with a stack of important-looking papers. I left
    the office grumbling about stupid work orders and how they always give me the
    wrong jack number and how it always made me look like an idiot. The receptionist
    giggled and told me to come back any time. I think she liked me. It was probably
    the helmet.

  zh: 我穿过大楼，从未受到挑战。有一次，我甚至走进了安保办公室。接待员看到我时很惊讶，直到我指着一个空桌子告诉她电话坏了。她不确定电话是否坏了，但还是让我进去了。毕竟，我是电话维修员。我把工具箱扔在桌子上，拿起电话听到了拨号音。我摇摇头，把电话放回底座上，然后把工具箱和一叠看起来很重要的文件一起搬离了桌子。我离开办公室，嘀咕着关于愚蠢的工作订单，以及他们总是给我错误的插孔号，以及这总是让我看起来像个白痴。接待员咯咯笑着告诉我随时欢迎再来。我想她可能喜欢我。可能是因为头盔吧。
- en: All in all, it was a good day. We popped yet another fortress with a series
    of simple, no-tech attacks. We left with piles of documents proving we had been
    inside, and my paperback-sized computer was loaded with hundreds of megabytes
    of sensitive State data. The employees never challenged me because they recognized
    the logo on my shirt and badge. Since the logos and the gear looked legit, I was
    probably who I appeared to be. But I had purposely played the role of a technician
    from the *wrong* phone company. The company I selected was a recognized data and
    voice service provider, but they didn’t provide local hardware support. In layman’s
    terms, even if I was an employee of that phone company, I had no business being
    in the facility, and even if I did, I wouldn’t have been testing phone handsets.

  zh: 总的来说，那是一个不错的一天。我们通过一系列简单的、无技术含量的攻击再次攻破了一座要塞。我们带走了大量文件，证明我们已经进入内部，而我的袖珍电脑装满了数百兆敏感的国家数据。员工们从未质疑我，因为他们认出了我衬衫和徽章上的标志。由于标志和装备看起来合法，我很可能就是我所表现出的样子。但我故意扮演了一个来自*错误*电话公司的技术员。我选择的公司是一家知名的数据和语音服务提供商，但他们不提供本地硬件支持。简单来说，即使我是那家电话公司的员工，我也没有理由进入该设施，即使我进入了，我也不会测试电话手柄。
- en: It all boiled down to playing a convincing role. I used the age-old technique
    of tailgating to gain initial access to the building and then threw in a healthy
    dose of social engineering to schmooze everyone I ran into inside the building.
    Every employee took me at face value, even though any one of them could have put

    of my license plate number and called it in to the local phone technician stalker
    hotline. So much for stealth. Once I even stepped off the sidewalk into a row
    of bushes to snag a quality covert photo of an approaching delivery guy. The photo

    just *ask* my target for permission to snap a few photos. I ask politely (avoiding
    those stalker vibes) and most people are more than happy to oblige me. In some
    cases, I make up a story about my kid liking big trucks, and ask if my target
    would mind posing for a quick photo. After, all, who’s going to deny a little
    kid happiness? The delivery guy shown in the next (heavily blurred) photo was
    extremely accommodating. I got a photo of his truck, his outfit and even his employee
    badge—more than enough detail to pull together a convincing delivery-guy persona.

    wander around inside a target building dressed as a delivery guy, helping myself
    to sooper-secret documents, there’s a problem with my target’s security program.
    What it boils down to is that most folks take the world at face value. If an employee
    sees a familiar logo on a badge or a polo shirt, he or she will naturally assume
    I am who I appear to be. It’s socially awkward to confront an unfamiliar person,

    in through a side door. Although I tailgated behind the employee, I later realized
    the door wasn’t even locked. It did, however sport an *Emergency Exit Only* sign.
    Once inside the building, I got my camera ready. As soon as I did, I found another
    employee wandering the hallway. I held the camera to my waist, and took the series
    of photos shown below.

  zh: 尾随描述了跟随一个人进入安全区域的行为，但进入只是开始。跟随我，看看一个典型的尾随会是什么样子。我通过一个侧门跟随一名员工进入了目标建筑物。尽管我在员工后面尾随，但后来我意识到门甚至没有锁。然而，门上却挂着一个*仅限紧急出口*的标志。一旦进入建筑物，我就准备好了相机。一旦准备好，我发现另一名员工在走廊里徘徊。我将相机放在腰间，拍下了下面一系列照片。

- en: The lady had a kind face and was very polite. I felt bad for snagging this rapid-fire
    series of photos that show the details of her lanyard and badge, but she wasn’t
    the only security-unconscious employee. I captured several other badge shots while
    inside the building.

    card readers. Opting for the no-tech approach, I ignored these locked spaces and
    continued wandering. I took the next photo outside one office suite.

  zh: 大多数办公室都被锁上，受到近距离读卡器的保护。选择不使用高科技的方法，我忽略了这些锁着的空间，继续漫步。我在一个办公室套房外拍下了下一张照片。

    handy personnel directory, it listed the calling features of the phone: call waiting,
    conference calling, call forwarding and call parking. The pile of mail, on the
    other hand, seemed very interesting. Adopting the hands-off approach, I didn’t
    rifle through it, but the top envelope was another American Express bill.'

  zh: 这部电话并没有像它本来那样有趣。它列出了电话的呼叫功能，而不是一个方便的人员目录：呼叫等待、电话会议、呼叫转移和呼叫停车。另一方面，邮件堆似乎很有趣。采取不动手的方法，我没有翻阅，但最上面的信封是另一张美国运通账单。

    a janitor’s closet. I angled myself to get a look inside, and froze in my tracks.

    was sitting before me, wide open and completely unattended. Not only that, but
    each of the consoles was logged in, allowing me to do whatever I wanted to the
    company’s phone and computer network systems. I could have installed a backdoor,
    dropped a worm (“… a multi-headed worm to break an encryption and sniff out digital
    footprints throughout an encrypted network,” as John Travolta in the movie *Swordfish*
    once said) or whatever I wanted. Or I could have opted for a less Hollywood approach
    and installed my own WAP or a hardware key logger. Either way, the company’s phone
    calls, emails and confidential info were at my disposal, without having to leverage
    a single high-tech attack.

  zh: 这不是一个清洁工储藏室，而是一个网络储藏室。这个尾随者的圣杯就在我面前，敞开着，完全无人看管。不仅如此，每个控制台都已登录，让我可以为公司的电话和计算机网络系统做任何我想做的事情。我可以安装后门，放置蠕虫（“…一个多头蠕虫，用来破解加密并在加密网络中搜索数字足迹，”正如约翰·特拉沃尔塔在电影*《剑鱼》*中所说）或者任何我想要的。或者我可以选择一个不那么好莱坞的方法，安装我的自己的WAP或硬件键盘记录器。无论哪种方式，公司的电话、电子邮件和机密信息都在我掌握之中，而无需使用任何高科技攻击。

    single real-world attack I’ve launched in my professional career has involved
    some sort of no-tech hacking angle. Keep your eyes open as you walk through your
    everyday life, think like a hacker, and you’ll begin to see these things as well.

    have no affiliation with them, and this attack in no way reflects a security problem
    with that particular phone company. Neither my company nor I endorse this kind
    of behavior except in conjunction with an authorized security test. And please
    don’t full-body tackle every poor phone technician you spot in the hallway.
