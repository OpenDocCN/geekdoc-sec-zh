    skill: peer-to-peer (P2P) hacking. In keeping with the spirit of no-tech, let’s
    assume a guy has no budget, no commercial hacking software, no support from organized
    crime and no fancy gear. In fact, let’s even take away Google. With all those
    restrictions, is this guy still a threat to you? Have a look at this chapter and
    judge for yourself.'

- en: A peer-to peer (P2P) network is composed of a number of clients (called peers)
    who want to share files or data. Most often, peer-to-peer networks carry audio,
    video or program files shared by users who join the network. The workings of a
    P2P network are beyond the scope of this book, but for our purposes, let’s just
    say that P2P is one of the most common file sharing services in existence. In
    order to join a P2P network, you simply download a P2P client (such as Acquisition
    for the Mac, shown below), run it and begin searching for files to download.

    files other P2P users have shared that contain the word *Beethoven.* Results are
    typically sorted by popularity. In the example above, the top three results include
    a piano concerto by Bach (mistakenly listed as being by Beethoven), and Beethoven’s
    7^(th) and 9^(th) symphonies. This brings up an interesting point—shared files
    on P2P networks are not always what they appear to be. A Bach concerto listed
    as being performed by Beethoven is a fairly benign example, but since any user
    can share any kind of file, the concerto could just as easily be anything: a movie
    about mayo, a picture of a pickle, or a file containing a computer virus. A malicious
    user could easily share any kind of nasty file. B the malicious files don’t interest
    me as much as the files shared accidentally.'

    task bar at the bottom is a shoulder surfer’s dream, but the Access database screen
    is a goldmine of information. The screen shows a cost savings report for a large
    company that lists very specific details about a project, including expenses and
    annual cost savings. The information is extremely dated, but based on the recognizable
    name of the company; someone would certainly be interested in more info just like
    it.

    computer. Most P2P clients allow you to browse all the shared files on a P2P user’s
    computer. If an attacker finds one marginally sensitive document, he’ll almost
    certainly browse the machine that shared the file to find more. Although his search
    will only be limited to the files that user is sharing, if the user’s sharing
    one sensitive document, he’s almost certainly sharing others.

    data. The most interesting thing to me is that the invoice lists item descriptions,
    which seem to layout a very high-end security system. It lists video servers (capable
    of supporting up to forty cameras), video encoders, power supplies and more. It
    seems ironic that the invoice for this high-tech security system would be sitting
    out on a P2P network for the world to see.

    document lists the customer’s name, address and phone number and goes on to list
    an entire month’s cellular phone history. It lists every call placed and every
    call received. It goes on to list the time, duration and charge of a month’s worth
    of calls. If a high-tech hacker were to try to gain access to this data electronically,
    it would be a difficult task. But for a no-tech hacker, it only takes a quick
    P2P hacking session or a round of dumpster diving.

- en: It’s scary to think about a hacker targeting your personal information, but
    understand that P2P hacking is not about targeting specific individuals. P2P hacking
    is about finding interesting information based on specific keywords. If a hacker’s
    after you, he or she is probably not going to log into a P2P client in search
    of your information because this makes the assumption that you’re running a P2P
    client *and* that you have shared personal data there. Both of these are rather
    wild assumptions. So if you do run P2P software, make sure you know exactly what
    it is you are sharing, and then focus your attention on making sure your personal
    firewall, and anti-virus/spyware/adware software is current and correctly configured.

    saved it as a file on the local hard drive. Unfortunately, it was saved into a

    was shared to the world. Unfortunately for this user, his name, bank account number

    and as the results scrolled down the screen, I could hardly believe my eyes. I
    saw file after file of records, private patient data, and meds (medication) requests.
    I was looking at private patient data. I was scrolling through a list of documents
    that contained some extremely sensitive patient medical data, and there was a
    good chance that others in the P2P network had already downloaded these documents.
    There was no telling where in the world this data had already traveled. This info
    made me realize that this probably wasn’t a personal machine—it was most likely
    the machine the doctor used for business. I decided to browse the machine a bit
    more. I clicked the *Movies* link at the top of the P2P screen and glanced through
    the results, shown in the next screen.

    to see if anyone was seeing what I was seeing. Most of the pornographic videos
    centered on sexy nurses, teenage girls and women in stockings. Some of the video
    titles were so disgusting I had to blur out the majority of the title to even
    present the photo. The most disturbing videos described sex acts with animals
    and mentioned terms like “white slave.” The videos were nasty enough, but then
    I remembered this was most likely a doctor’s machine. If this was the doctor’s
    machine, I wondered if his patients had any idea that he was not only completely
    irresponsible with their records, but that he was a complete sleaze to boot. I
    know I wouldn’t want a doctor that collected this kind of stuff touching anyone
    I cared about.

    was a non-disclosure agreement that the doctor’s employees were to sign and date,
    agreeing that they would not release patient information without a signed consent.
    It went on to state that employees had certain moral and professional obligations
    to protect patient confidentiality, and that there are penalties for the unauthorized
    release of patient information. I couldn’t believe that this document was sitting
    in the same folder as private patient data and hot nurse porn. But no-tech hackers
    see all sorts of interesting things.
