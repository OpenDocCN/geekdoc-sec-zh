    of the simplest test generation techniques: Fuzzing feeds a *string of random
    characters* into a program in the hope to uncover failures.'

    tests by assessing their *code coverage* – that is, measuring which parts of a
    program are actually executed during a test run. Measuring such coverage is also
    crucial for test generators that attempt to cover as much code as possible.

    inputs to exercise new behavior. We show how to create such mutations, and how
    to guide them towards yet uncovered code, applying central concepts from the popular
    AFL fuzzer.'
