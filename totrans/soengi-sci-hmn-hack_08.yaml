    chapter. Cooking is an art, but there is a science behind the way you use the
    tools—the way you wield the knife can make or break your abilities as a chef.
    Understanding the art of how to make food tasty is very important to a chef, and
    so is understanding how to prepare the food (usually minus finger parts) in a
    way that enhances the dish. Blending the art of food preparation and the science
    of putting it all together creates a perfectly balanced dish.

    the outside, does one room jut out farther than the others? Do you have an odd-shaped
    sun room, or is it just a square? How it looks—where the walls are, where the
    windows are placed, the location of the doors, and so on—is determined by how
    the house is framed out. In other words, what you see and perceive about your
    house is based on how the framing was done.

    or how someone views and reacts to a certain situation, as largely based on what
    that person has experienced or understood throughout their life. And those frames,

    the great waves.

    We unloaded all our boards and waxed up. We still had about 30 minutes before
    the sun would be up enough for us to clearly see, but we were anxious and 16 years
    old, so we decided to paddle out in the dark to catch the first wave as soon as
    the sun had come up. We could hear waves crashing on shore, and we could also
    make out the silhouette of some really large wave sets in the distance.

    of fishermen on a pier pretty close to us—chumming the waters for shark! The shotgun
    blasts we'd heard were from the fishermen dispatching the sharks as they reeled
    them in. So, my friends and I were sitting in pools of chum. We laughed about
    it with an almost idiotic sense of humor about how dangerous it was.

    and living dangerously was part of my life. Now, as the father of two, a business
    owner, and a person who wants to live, the idea of being in chum-filled, shark-infested

    suspension, and this principle is the very *opposite* of that. In this case, you're

    sense of self-esteem or self-importance.” This is important to understand because
    when we hear this, we may automatically assume we have to inflate the target's
    ego, but that is not what I am saying. I'm saying you have to *appeal* to their
    ego.

    would ask me some questions, and I wanted to preempt her, so I said, “Hi there.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Just as it sounds, an open-ended question is one that doesn't direct the receiver
    in any particular direction but instead allows them to answer solely from their
    opinion. Open-ended questions generally can't be answered with a simple yes or
    no. An open-ended question allows the target to decide how much information they
    will provide. This is empowering and validating for the person involved, and it
    can help build rapport. An open-ended question is something like, “What is your
    favorite restaurant in town?”; as opposed to, “Is there a good restaurant close
    to this hotel?” Both are valid questions, but one elicits information that will
    enable you to profile the target more thoroughly. The words you use within a question
    elicit emotions, and those emotions affect the answer you get. An open-ended question
    encourages the target to engage their knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, opinions,
    and feelings.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The success of these questions is largely dependent on the way you, as a professional
    social engineer, employ active listening and direct the questions to obtain useful
    information. This is important to understand, so when you are formulating your
    pretext, you can start to plan what type of questions you would naturally use.
    Remember, the goal is to keep the target talking openly about relevant details
    that can assist in the end goal of completing the social engineering engagement.

    one you may recall is when I asked Alicia the security guard about the elevators.
    She not only answered the question but went on to tell me about the new security

    allowed me to gather not just a badge but critical intel on their security systems.  ####
    *Closed-Ended Questions*'

- en: Closed-ended questions elicit brief and narrow answers. Usually, they can be
    answered with one or two words. Skilled interrogators often use closed-ended questions
    to verify facts they've already obtained. In addition, closed-ended questions
    are excellent to use for reading nonverbals. When a closed-ended question is asked,
    our bodies answer before our mouths do. Most of the time, our body language gives
    an honest answer even if we state a lie. We might shrug or shake our head no but
    say the word “Yes.”

    might say this to one of them: “I told you that 11:00 p.m. was bedtime. Did you
    actually shut down the computer and go to bed at 11?” The head shakes *no* but
    the child says, “I think so. I didn''t see the exact time.”'

- en: A benefit to closed-ended questions is that they ensure the social engineer
    is able to elicit details and secure specific bits of information. When you're
    using closed-ended questions, it's a good idea to start off with basic questions
    before getting to anything too deep. The basics of who, what, where, why, and
    how are good places to begin.

    with Alicia about seeing any news regarding to the problems in ABC Corporation,
    she shrugged and replied, “Yes.” This incongruence tells me she wasn''t really
    sure if she knew about this. Because of my perception of her confusion, I could

    combining a statement with a leading question: “I understand that I''m not on
    the schedule, Beth, so how do you suggest we explain to Mr. Smith that I could
    not fix his computer after he comes back from his holiday?'

    a building. I have a clipboard with a camera embedded in the front. There is a
    large (quarter-size) hole with a lens protruding and another smaller hole with
    a microphone. I constantly worry that a target will see it. I put a work order
    or other paper on the front of the clipboard, and with a nice metal pen, I tap
    on that paper while saying something like, “Yeah, you see here? I'm supposed to
    check the serial number of the motor to see if there's a recall.” So far, no one
    has ever seen the camera, because I lead them to look away from it.
