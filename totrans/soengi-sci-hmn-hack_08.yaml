    would ask me some questions, and I wanted to preempt her, so I said, “Hi there.
    I'm Paul from corporate.” I pulled out my badge and showed it to her briefly,
    but I wasn't sure how accurate it was, so I pulled my pen out and pointed to the

  id: totrans-239

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Just as it sounds, an open-ended question is one that doesn't direct the receiver
    in any particular direction but instead allows them to answer solely from their
    opinion. Open-ended questions generally can't be answered with a simple yes or
    no. An open-ended question allows the target to decide how much information they
    will provide. This is empowering and validating for the person involved, and it
    can help build rapport. An open-ended question is something like, “What is your
    favorite restaurant in town?”; as opposed to, “Is there a good restaurant close
    to this hotel?” Both are valid questions, but one elicits information that will
    enable you to profile the target more thoroughly. The words you use within a question
    elicit emotions, and those emotions affect the answer you get. An open-ended question
    encourages the target to engage their knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, opinions,
    and feelings.
  id: totrans-240

- en: The success of these questions is largely dependent on the way you, as a professional
    social engineer, employ active listening and direct the questions to obtain useful
    information. This is important to understand, so when you are formulating your
    pretext, you can start to plan what type of questions you would naturally use.
    Remember, the goal is to keep the target talking openly about relevant details
    that can assist in the end goal of completing the social engineering engagement.

    one you may recall is when I asked Alicia the security guard about the elevators.

    allowed me to gather not just a badge but critical intel on their security systems.  ####
    *Closed-Ended Questions*'
  id: totrans-242

- en: Closed-ended questions elicit brief and narrow answers. Usually, they can be
    answered with one or two words. Skilled interrogators often use closed-ended questions
    to verify facts they've already obtained. In addition, closed-ended questions
    are excellent to use for reading nonverbals. When a closed-ended question is asked,
    our bodies answer before our mouths do. Most of the time, our body language gives
    an honest answer even if we state a lie. We might shrug or shake our head no but
    say the word “Yes.”

    the child says, “I think so. I didn''t see the exact time.”'

    is able to elicit details and secure specific bits of information. When you're
    using closed-ended questions, it's a good idea to start off with basic questions
    before getting to anything too deep. The basics of who, what, where, why, and
    how are good places to begin.

    with Alicia about seeing any news regarding to the problems in ABC Corporation,
    she shrugged and replied, “Yes.” This incongruence tells me she wasn''t really
    sure if she knew about this. Because of my perception of her confusion, I could

    scenario, I was able to lead the target to thinking about possible repercussions

    a building. I have a clipboard with a camera embedded in the front. There is a
    large (quarter-size) hole with a lens protruding and another smaller hole with
    a microphone. I constantly worry that a target will see it. I put a work order
    or other paper on the front of the clipboard, and with a nice metal pen, I tap
    on that paper while saying something like, “Yeah, you see here? I'm supposed to
    check the serial number of the motor to see if there's a recall.” So far, no one
    has ever seen the camera, because I lead them to look away from it.
