    priority level.  This priority level may change during an incident as additional
    information emerges.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    options.  Each priority level needs to have definitive and easy to understand
    criteria.  After all, there are some incidents in some organizations so severe
    they can cost millions of dollars per minute if they are left unfixed and others
    that turn out to have little to no financial impact at all.

    will be far less than if it were a business-critical system impacting hundreds,
    thousands or even millions of people.  A low-value, low-user system can potentially
    be permitted to stay offline for a short time.  Conversely, many businesses cannot
    afford for some systems to have any downtime at all.  Think about airline or hotel
    reservation systems, or auction and property websites.  Even a few seconds or
    minutes of interruption can result in huge financial losses.

    only the immediate incident, but the wider implications.  For example, if I have
    a malware infection on a small system, I may still need to assign it a priority
    category, if during the verification stage it is determined that the problem could
    quickly spread to much higher-value parts of the attack surface.

    incident needs to be escalated.  Escalation to management can happen at any time
    during an incident, if it is expected to cause substantial business disruption
    or because the incident cannot be managed inside normal tolerances.

    unfinished stage of the incident management to be completed.  If the time allowed
    for one stage is exceeded, or the security incident manager is expecting the time

    as being in an alert status.

    of a major cyber attack.  We also previously discussed the fact that the earlier
    a problem is identified, the cheaper it is to fix.  Although prevention is cheaper
    than incident management, it is also true that the earlier in an attack or intrusion
    lifecycle the problem is identified, the less it is likely to cost to fix.  For
    that reason, a concept known as the kill chain is often used to help the incident
    team understand how far into the lifecycle the problem has been detected.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '| kill chain – a conceptual cyber defense model that uses the structure of
    attack as a model to build a cyber defense strategy.  The stages in an advanced
    persistent threat are typically used as a framework, with cyber defense strategies
    (detect, deny, disrupt, degrade, deceive, contain) considered at each stage. 
    The model works on the premise that the earlier in the lifecycle that an attack
    can be detected and defeated, the lower the cost incurred and damage will be. 
    This model can be a useful adjunct to a defense strategy, but also has inherent
    gaps; for example, it works best for internal organizational networks, but is
    less effective when applied to information outside of a defended perimeter.  The
    model does, however, very successfully emphasize that cyber attacks are much less
    expensive to deal with when they are identified earlier in the cyber attack lifecycle. 
    This same model is also used during incident management to determine how far an
    attack has progressed, to help advise managers on probable costs and strategies
    to defeat it. |'

    he or she cuts, incident responders strive to precisely and carefully isolate
    the affected digital components to minimize system disruptions and to maximize
    the amount of organization-wide support for the incident response.  Where network
    segmentation and redundant systems are in place, it is easier for the incident

    to exactly the way it was.  This makes it essential for the team to include, or
    to be able to urgently access, experts who are capable of identifying temporary
    workarounds that can put alternative solutions in place until the affected component
    can itself be fixed.  Appropriate access to business continuity and disaster recovery
    plans are likely to be critical during this stage.
