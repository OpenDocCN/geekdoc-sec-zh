    my discussion of accommodating nonverbals in [Chapter 5](c05.xhtml)), then it
    is easier for someone to trust you, feel comfortable with you, and therefore like
    you.

  zh: 非语言在其中起到了重要作用。当你的非语言是真实的（记得我在[第五章](c05.xhtml)中讨论的适应性非语言），那么别人就更容易信任你、感到舒适，因此喜欢你。
- en: The running theme of all these things is that your expression of liking must
    be genuine. My good friend Robin Dreeke accomplishes this by looking at each person
    as his or her own reality TV show. He doesn't have to like your life, or the things
    you do, but he has enough interest to want to find out the plot and how it unfolds.
    That desire to find out is genuine, and that genuineness comes across, which allows
    trust and rapport to be built and influence to be applied much more easily.

    the best telephone technician outfit I could build on short notice. Instead of
    going directly into my target's office, I went to the building next door first.
    I went in and introduced myself as Paul, a local telephone technician from XYZ
    Telephone Company. I said I'd be servicing the area and left a fake business card.

    experiencing a fluctuation with the telephone lines, which is causing outages
    of both phone and Internet in the area. I need to check each company on the block
    to ensure there are no problems in the system settings.” The woman at the desk
    started to interrupt me, but I pushed through and looked down at my clipboard

    also ran the test on your other neighbor over here, but Fred was happy it wasn't
    them. So, I figured since I am out here, I should just run the tests on your system

    had to figure out that there was a panel that, when pressed, could stop the pain.
    But in other cases, the lever did nothing to stop the pain of the shocks, and
    those dogs learned there was nothing they could do to stop the punishment—so they
    accepted it as part of life and lay there whimpering in pain without attempting

- en: As disturbing as this study is to read about, it holds an important aspect to
    understanding the principles of manipulation. Many times, the subject will accept
    something they fear, that hurts, or that they know is bad simply because they
    don't see any other option. Fear and anger override the brain's ability to think
    rationally, which leaves only emotion for making decisions. As a professional
    social engineer, removing the option to think with logic, in most cases also removes
    the ability for there to be a teaching moment. After the target finds out their
    fears were used as a test, it leads to many negative emotions that leave the person
    not wanting to learn from you.

    we have used manipulation as a tactic, to ensure they feel okay and are not too

- en: 'If you take away only one important thing from this chapter, let it be this:
    You are human (just as I am human). Influence works—plain and simple. It works
    on your targets, and it works on you. It is impossible to stop it, no matter how
    hard you try.'
