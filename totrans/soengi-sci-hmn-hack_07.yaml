    focus on influence. How do you define influence?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I define it as “getting someone to *want* to do what you want them to do.” This
    means that the person has the idea to do what you want them to, or at least that
    is the way they will remember it. Because the person perceives the idea as his
    or her own, it is a great idea, and the person is committed to it.

    has been researching, writing about, and perfecting the art of influence for decades
    now. In episode 86 of *The Social-Engineer Podcast*, I was privileged to have
    Bob, as he asked to be called, on the show. It was one of the most fascinating
    conversations I have had, and one that I learned so much from.

    of Persuasion* (William Morrow and Co., 1984). In it, he discusses six principles

    I have broken Bob''s six principles into eight principles.'

    linked to influence. Simply put, framing is the foundation on which your beliefs,
    viewpoints, and thoughts are based. Later in the chapter, I discuss how you can
    alter those frames in your targets. I also discuss manipulation, the darker more
    sinister cousin to influence, and then I summarize everything, give you some tips,
    and send you on your way to mastering this amazing talent.  ## Principle One:
    Reciprocity'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This principle is very much like reciprocal altruism in rapport building. It's
    based on the way humans want to reciprocate to those who do kind things or give
    us things that we enjoy. According to Cialdini, even if we don't want the item
    given to us, our brains are unsettled until we feel that we have paid back the
    giver. Marketers know this and use this principle all the time.

    indebted.

    But in other cases, the lever did nothing to stop the pain of the shocks, and

    accepted it as part of life and lay there whimpering in pain without attempting

    understanding the principles of manipulation. Many times, the subject will accept
    something they fear, that hurts, or that they know is bad simply because they
    don't see any other option. Fear and anger override the brain's ability to think
    rationally, which leaves only emotion for making decisions. As a professional
    social engineer, removing the option to think with logic, in most cases also removes
    the ability for there to be a teaching moment. After the target finds out their
    fears were used as a test, it leads to many negative emotions that leave the person
    not wanting to learn from you.
