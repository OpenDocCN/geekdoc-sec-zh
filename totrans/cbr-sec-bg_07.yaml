    of knowledge that help us understand how alike it is to any other set of knowledge. 
    For information security, this is usually achieved by assigning values against
    confidentiality, integrity and availability, or CIA. A fourth category, consent,
    is also sometimes used when the set of knowledge includes information on private
    individuals.  This assignment of categories can then be used to more easily select
    the security and recovery approach appropriate to the information’s value and
    impact.confidentiality – the assignment of a value to a set of information to
    indicate the level of secrecy and the access restrictions required to prevent
    unauthorized people from viewing it.  A typical example of a confidentiality scale
    is: (i) Public Use (ii) Internal Use (iii) Confidential (iv) Strictly Confidential
    and (v) Restricted.integrity* – a value that can be assigned to a set of information
    to indicate how sensitive it is to degradation of accuracy (such as unauthorized
    modification) or data loss.  Loss in this context is about losing information
    without the ability for anyone to recover it from the system it was entered into
    (it is not about theft).  This value is often expressed or translated into a scale
    of time.  The integrity value assigned to any system or application is used to
    set the frequency that the information is subject to backup, or in very sensitive
    systems with no data loss permitted, establishes the need for a permanent secondary
    failover system.availability* – the assignment of a value to a set of information
    to indicate how much disruption or outage the owner considers to be acceptable. 
    This is often expressed or translated into a scale of time. Data with the highest
    possible availability rating would be required to be readily accessible at all
    times (no downtime permitted), often through the use of a fully redundant failsafe.consent
    – when personal electronic information is involved, there are often legal constraints
    that govern how the data can be used and where the information can be viewed,
    stored, transmitted or otherwise processed.  In these circumstances, permission
    is often required from each individual to specify which information can be collected,
    where it can be processed and for how long it will be retained.  These permissions
    can be represented by a series of tags on individual records or on the full data
    set.  The attributes that require explicit permission may include, but are not
    limited to, country of origin, permission for export, limitations of use, retention

    repetitions that encompass both initial security measures and later re-evaluations
    and updates.  This means that the cybersecurity team ensures that appropriate
    security is applied to any set of information and the assets it flows through
    from the outset – and that these measures are re-visited and updated on a regular
    basis (perhaps annually), as well as anytime there is a change or upgrade.

    policies are not valid (will not pay out) unless the insured company proves that

    be blamed for any vulnerabilities that resulted from its failure to run its cybersecurity
    processes effectively.
