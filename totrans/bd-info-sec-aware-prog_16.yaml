- en: Measuring effectiveness of an awareness program can be challenging, especially
    for those without a risk management background. This chapter covers selecting
    valuable measurements and creating useable metrics. Proper reporting and presentation
    of metrics is discussed in detail, as it is critical to gaining understanding
    and support from senior management.

- en: An often forgotten part of an awareness program is a method of tracking progress
    and measuring impact. These metrics are to be used as a guide for making adjustments
    to the program and reporting progress to senior management. If your organization
    has a risk management team, consult with them on their current metrics program.
    It's likely that a portion of their collected data could be used for awareness
    training metrics.

    counting [[1](#bb0010)]. An example of a measurement is the number of infected
    computers reported last month.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Metrics are generated by the analysis of measurements. A metric is a comparison
    of two or more measurements taken over a certain amount of time and compared to
    a predetermined baseline [[1](#bb0010)]. For example, the number of infected computers
    increased by 5% in the second quarter from the first quarter. Useable metrics
    are dependent on accurate measurements.

    steps to obtain them. Documentation of required measurements and responsible individuals
    is key. The following example is from the SANS community website [[2](#bb0015)].
    Many awareness program resources are available, including a sample metrics matrix
    at [https://www.securingthehuman.org/resources/security-awareness-roadmap/](https://www.securingthehuman.org/resources/security-awareness-roadmap/).
    Each metric should have the following segments at minimum.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Measurements are objective raw data, meaning no human interpretation is required
    to obtain the measurement value. A measurement for phishing detection is the number
    of suspicious e-mails reported to the security team. This measurement is designed
    to evaluate the number of employees who followed the proper procedure for reporting
    suspicious messages. While this measurement alone is sufficient, an additional
    measurement can provide more insight. Measuring the number of help desk calls
    or e-mails about suspicious e-mail can also be useful, as it can indicate the
    number of employees who did not follow the proper procedure.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A common way to obtain phishing detection measurements is to perform an assessment.
    To continue with the phishing detection example, a measurement of how many suspicious
    e-mails were reported to security would be collected at the end of each phishing
    assessment ([Figure 13.1](#f0010)). If you're using a commercial tool, the number
    of e-mails sent during each assessment is available from the reporting screen.

- en: Phishing exercise measurements should be obtained at the end of each assessment.
    If your organization performs biannual assessments, then collect the data biannually.
    However, not all reported e-mails are assessment-related. Therefore, nonassessment
    data should be collected on a monthly basis.

- en: Multiple information sources exist for this metric. The security team collects
    the number of suspicious e-mails received. Phishing assessment-related data are
    collected by the assessment point of contact. The help desk collects the number
    of e-mails and phone calls received in reference to phishing e-mails.

    on deployment. Even if your awareness program isn't fully implemented, collecting
    operational measurements is important to demonstrate improvement over time.

- en: Metrics are designed to provide viewers with the information they need to make
    decisions. However, if the metrics are presented incorrectly, they will be considered
    ineffective and reflect poorly on the awareness program. The secret to properly
    presenting metrics is understanding the target audience.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One popular presentation style is the tiered approach [[3](#bb0020)]. At the
    top tier, senior management is interested in high-level information that provides
    insight into program maturity, cost, and benefits. It's essential to show that
    the awareness program is having a positive impact on the overall security culture
    of the organization. The middle tier, middle management, requires information
    at a department level to evaluate performance levels and potential business impact.
    The lowest tier consists of awareness program managers and personnel. This tier
    requires detailed information in order to adjust program content for better performance.

    Charts are the most popular style of metric reporting. However, a chart is only
    useful if it depicts the data in a meaningful way. Selecting the correct type
    of chart for you data is essential. The three main categories of charts are comparison,
    transition, and composition [[4](#bb0025)].
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Comparison charts are best for identifying highs and lows of numbers. The number
    of reported suspicious e-mails per quarter over a two-year period is best represented
    in this format ([Figure 13.2](#f0015)). Clustered bar charts and column charts
    are the most popular representations.

    The number of visits to the security awareness website and the number of employees
    who fell prey to a phishing exercise are both excellent candidates for a transition
    chart ([Figure 13.3](#f0020)). Line and area charts are best suited to represent
    this type of data.

    training completed by each department is best represented as a composition chart.
    Many phishing assessment details can also be presented this way. The percentage
    of employees that opened a phishing e-mail, the percentage of employees that clicked
    the enclosed link, and the percentage of employees that did not open the e-mail
    can be represented in a composition chart ([Figure 13.4](#f0025)). Pie charts
    are the most popular representation of this type of data; however, a stacked bar
    chart can also be utilized.

    color choices are tempting, they are often difficult to see if projected. Above
    all, keep slides and report sections simple. One slide should discuss one subject
    only. Mixing subjects and metrics on a slide often distracts the viewer, making
    the presentation difficult to understand.
