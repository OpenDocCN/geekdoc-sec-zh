- en: Social engineering attacks have damaged US National Security and compromised
    intelligence and military operations for several decades. Many of those attacks
    were perpetrated by insiders who engineered their way into government agencies
    only to end up walking away with sensitive and classified materials. It is just
    not the government that is at risk, all organizations face some level of threat
    from insiders, and the possibility that an insider may collaborate and conspire
    with an outsider to steal, sabotage, or humiliate their employees. Managers and
    security personnel need to be just as concerned about insiders utilizing social
    engineering tactics as they are about outside social engineers working to compromise
    systems employees and suppliers. In this chapter, we turn our attention to the
    efforts of social engineering attacks by insiders.

    will do with them, or who outside the organization considers the data to be of
    value enough for somebody to steal. There are numerous potential scenarios that
    can lead the insider to steal data and information. They could already have a
    buyer and could be conspiring with an outsider to illegally transfer the material.
    They also may be seeking a new job and intend to use the information and data
    as leverage to gain new employment by offering it to companies that may hire them.
    In some cases they may want to make an organization’s data and information public
    by posting it on the Internet in order to reveal things about the business or
    government agency that may disrupt processes and jeopardize business relationships,
    or attract people who want to embarrass an organization or expose activity that
    they and others considered unethical or illegal. No matter why the theft occurs,
    organizations need to take steps to be sure that they are protected.

    organizations more vulnerable to insider offenses. Many organizations have gone
    through some sort of downsizing reducing their headcount and often combining job
    functions with an eye on financial savings and without any specific regard for
    security. There has also been a trend toward having more open organizations and
    providing employees with access to more tools, resources, and data in the hope
    that the new leaner organizations will become more productive by empowering employees.
    In addition, the information technology (IT) industry has greatly focused on bringing
    products to market that are advertised to provide employees with more tools so
    they can have more access and be more productive. All of these trends were based

    such as smartphones, flash drives, and other devices that better enable them to
    spy or steal intellectual property. The Internet allows insiders to quickly move
    data or information out of an organization’s facility. The Internet can also provide
    a communication platform for insiders to stay in contact with outside co-conspirators
    regarding their actions or the types of information they should look for and misappropriate.
    This communication can also aid insiders in providing outsiders with access to
    internal resources or make it easier to access physical properties or assets that
    could be the target of theft or destruction. Protecting against such threats is
    an absolute necessity in all security efforts.

    hack information systems from the outside because they already have some knowledge,

    the access control for computer systems. They also may have very few restrictions

    sensitive computer systems, networks, and data is the insider threat. An insider
    is an individual who possesses a certain level of access, privilege, and trust
    within an organization due to their position, role, or task within that organization.
    The Department of Defense (DoD) defines an insider as anyone who uses authorized
    credentials to access a DoD computer and/or network, regardless of whether or
    not those credentials were acquired through legal channels. While an outsider
    must gain access and privilege to a system using social engineering or some other
    method in order to damage that system, an insider generally inherits those capabilities
    by default. At this point, the only thing that separates an insider employee from
    an insider threat is their actions and intentions. Each insider poses the threat
    of malicious activity. Most organizations assume an insider is honest and is operating
    in the best interests of the organization. However, what if an insider’s intentions
    change from benign to malicious?

- en: Government agencies and military commands constantly need to address how they
    detect malicious behavior from within their own walls? Modern-day computer defenses
    range from firewalls to intrusion detection systems (IDS) to access control lists
    (ACL), but their primary focus of mitigating the outsider threat remains the same.
    An insider is given a natural migration path inside the perimeter of enterprise
    security controls. Efforts to incorporate these same defenses against insiders
    have thus far been fruitless. A great need still exists for a real-time, lightweight
    detection and mitigation systems for insider misuse. Access control is the fundamental
    basis of computer security, but still remains a relative weakness in dealing with
    everyday threats, especially those posed by insiders. Authentication, authorization,
    and audit are the three primary components of access control, which can be observed
    in countless mainstream implementations, including firewalls, virtual private
    networks, and file permissions.

    are too ­coarse-grained, complex, and non-scalable to oppose the insider threat.
    Modern-day operating systems enforce access control at the granularity level of
    a file, but that does little to stop an insider who already has access to that
    file based on their position within the organization. The insider threat is minimally

    threat personnel gathering information from many sources and analyzing that information
    for clues or behaviors of concern. A single indicator may say little; however,
    if taken together with other indicators, a pattern of concerning behavior may
    arise that can add up to someone who could pose a threat. It is important to consider

    deserves closer scrutiny, or whether a matter should be formally brought to the
    attention of an investigative or administrative entity, such as the FBI or an

    investigation records of current, former, and prospective federal employees and
    contractors had been stolen. The OPM and the interagency incident response team
    concluded with high confidence that sensitive information, including the SSNs
    of 21.5 million individuals, was stolen from the background investigation databases.
    This includes 19.7 million individuals that applied for a background investigation,
    and 1.8 million non-applicants, primarily spouses or co-habitants of applicants.
    Some records also include findings from interviews conducted by background investigators
    and approximately 5.6 million include fingerprints. Usernames and passwords that
    applicants used to fill out their background investigation forms were also stolen.
    While background investigation records do contain some information regarding mental
    health and financial history provided by applicants and people contacted during
    the background investigation, there is no evidence that health, financial, payroll,
    and retirement records of federal personnel or those who have applied for a federal

    If the insider needs a truck, needs to have some heavy lifting done, or needs
    to augment their computer skills in order to perpetrate a fraud scheme they may
    team up with an outsider. Outside help may be seen as safer for the insider because
