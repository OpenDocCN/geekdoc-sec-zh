- en: Social engineering attacks have damaged US National Security and compromised
    intelligence and military operations for several decades. Many of those attacks
    were perpetrated by insiders who engineered their way into government agencies
    only to end up walking away with sensitive and classified materials. It is just
    not the government that is at risk, all organizations face some level of threat
    from insiders, and the possibility that an insider may collaborate and conspire
    with an outsider to steal, sabotage, or humiliate their employees. Managers and
    security personnel need to be just as concerned about insiders utilizing social
    engineering tactics as they are about outside social engineers working to compromise
    systems employees and suppliers. In this chapter, we turn our attention to the
    efforts of social engineering attacks by insiders.

    will do with them, or who outside the organization considers the data to be of
    value enough for somebody to steal. There are numerous potential scenarios that
    can lead the insider to steal data and information. They could already have a
    buyer and could be conspiring with an outsider to illegally transfer the material.
    They also may be seeking a new job and intend to use the information and data
    as leverage to gain new employment by offering it to companies that may hire them.
    In some cases they may want to make an organization’s data and information public
    by posting it on the Internet in order to reveal things about the business or
    government agency that may disrupt processes and jeopardize business relationships,
    or attract people who want to embarrass an organization or expose activity that
    they and others considered unethical or illegal. No matter why the theft occurs,
    organizations need to take steps to be sure that they are protected.

    organizations more vulnerable to insider offenses. Many organizations have gone
    through some sort of downsizing reducing their headcount and often combining job
    functions with an eye on financial savings and without any specific regard for
    security. There has also been a trend toward having more open organizations and
    providing employees with access to more tools, resources, and data in the hope
    that the new leaner organizations will become more productive by empowering employees.
    In addition, the information technology (IT) industry has greatly focused on bringing
    products to market that are advertised to provide employees with more tools so
    they can have more access and be more productive. All of these trends were based
    more on hope than they were on proven results.

    such as smartphones, flash drives, and other devices that better enable them to
    spy or steal intellectual property. The Internet allows insiders to quickly move
    data or information out of an organization’s facility. The Internet can also provide
    a communication platform for insiders to stay in contact with outside co-conspirators
    regarding their actions or the types of information they should look for and misappropriate.
    This communication can also aid insiders in providing outsiders with access to
    internal resources or make it easier to access physical properties or assets that
    could be the target of theft or destruction. Protecting against such threats is
    an absolute necessity in all security efforts.

    Some attacks occur for revenge or out of anger against the organization or managers
    and staff. Other attacks involving theft of data or trade secrets often happen
    for financial gain. The FBI contends that insiders do not need to know how to
    hack information systems from the outside because they already have some knowledge,
    and at times extensive knowledge, of an organization’s information systems and
    the access control for computer systems. They also may have very few restrictions

    and mishandling physical devices or improperly configured access control systems.
    Insiders do not always act alone and may not be aware they are aiding a threat
    actor (i.e., the unintentional insider threat). It is vital that organizations
    understand normal employee baseline behaviors and also ensure employees understand
    how they may be used as a conduit for others to obtain information. Types of crimes

- en: Many security professionals contend that the biggest modern-day threat against
    sensitive computer systems, networks, and data is the insider threat. An insider
    is an individual who possesses a certain level of access, privilege, and trust
    within an organization due to their position, role, or task within that organization.
    The Department of Defense (DoD) defines an insider as anyone who uses authorized
    credentials to access a DoD computer and/or network, regardless of whether or
    not those credentials were acquired through legal channels. While an outsider
    must gain access and privilege to a system using social engineering or some other
    method in order to damage that system, an insider generally inherits those capabilities
    by default. At this point, the only thing that separates an insider employee from
    an insider threat is their actions and intentions. Each insider poses the threat
    of malicious activity. Most organizations assume an insider is honest and is operating
    in the best interests of the organization. However, what if an insider’s intentions
    change from benign to malicious?

- en: Government agencies and military commands constantly need to address how they
    detect malicious behavior from within their own walls? Modern-day computer defenses
    range from firewalls to intrusion detection systems (IDS) to access control lists
    (ACL), but their primary focus of mitigating the outsider threat remains the same.
    An insider is given a natural migration path inside the perimeter of enterprise
    security controls. Efforts to incorporate these same defenses against insiders
    have thus far been fruitless. A great need still exists for a real-time, lightweight
    detection and mitigation systems for insider misuse. Access control is the fundamental
    basis of computer security, but still remains a relative weakness in dealing with
    everyday threats, especially those posed by insiders. Authentication, authorization,
    and audit are the three primary components of access control, which can be observed
    in countless mainstream implementations, including firewalls, virtual private
    networks, and file permissions.

    control. In Discretionary Access Control (DAC), the owner of an object can assign
    access to other users. In Mandatory Access Control (MAC), access is granted to
    users based on security policy. Unfortunately, current access control mechanisms
    are too ­coarse-grained, complex, and non-scalable to oppose the insider threat.
    Modern-day operating systems enforce access control at the granularity level of
    a file, but that does little to stop an insider who already has access to that
    file based on their position within the organization. The insider threat is minimally
    addressed by current information security practices, yet the insider poses the
    most serious threat to the organization for various reasons, which are shown in
    Box 7.2.

    insider threats in terms of over-privileges based on the least-privilege principle,
    but cannot prevent the privilege-abuse problem. Applied computer forensic approaches
    are necessary to thwart the privilege-abuse problems where an insider does not
    have to violate access controls to perform malicious acts, as well as privilege
    escalation issues, where an insider would use various approaches to gain additional
    privileges such as root access. When used in combination, strong access control
    and applied computer forensics will serve to mitigate the threats posed by malicious
    insiders. The primary objective of current research is to develop applied computer
    forensic approaches for preventing and detecting insider threats in sensitive
    organizations in conjunction with advanced access control systems such as FASAC

    maintained by name brand companies. Many of these cases have gone on to be solved
    but millions of identities were compromised in the process, which helps to illustrate
    the need for much better security than currently exists to protect personal and
    financial data. However, many cases of security breaches of customer data or PII
    go unsolved and are never prosecuted.

    database exposed the personal information of up to 500 million people. According
    to Marriott, the hackers accessed people’s names, addresses, phone numbers, email
    addresses, passport numbers, dates of birth, gender, Starwood loyalty program
    account information, and reservation information. For some, they also stole payment
    card numbers and expiration dates. Marriott said the payment card numbers were
    encrypted, but it did not yet know if the hackers also stole the information needed
    to decrypt them. The hotel chain said the breach began in 2014 and anyone who
    made a reservation at a Starwood property on or before September 10, 2018, could
    be affected. Starwood brands include W Hotels, St. Regis, Sheraton Hotels & Resorts,

    related cybersecurity incidents that impacted the data of federal government employees,
    contractors, and others. In June 2015, the OPM discovered that the background
    investigation records of current, former, and prospective federal employees and
    contractors had been stolen. The OPM and the interagency incident response team
    concluded with high confidence that sensitive information, including the SSNs
    of 21.5 million individuals, was stolen from the background investigation databases.
    This includes 19.7 million individuals that applied for a background investigation,
    and 1.8 million non-applicants, primarily spouses or co-habitants of applicants.
    Some records also include findings from interviews conducted by background investigators
    and approximately 5.6 million include fingerprints. Usernames and passwords that
    applicants used to fill out their background investigation forms were also stolen.
    While background investigation records do contain some information regarding mental
    health and financial history provided by applicants and people contacted during
    the background investigation, there is no evidence that health, financial, payroll,
    and retirement records of federal personnel or those who have applied for a federal
    job were impacted by this incident (e.g., annuity rolls, retirement records, USA
    JOBS, Employee Express). In 2015, the OPM discovered that the personnel data of
    4.2 million current and former federal government employees had been stolen. This
    meant that information such as full name, birth date, home address, and SSNs were
    affected.

    impacted by the incident involving background investigations. If people had undergone
    a background investigation prior to 2000, they may still have been impacted, but

    to settle charges that it misled investors by failing to disclose one of the world’s
    largest data breaches in which hackers stole personal data relating to hundreds
    of millions of user accounts. According to the SEC’s order, within days of the
    December 2014 intrusion, Yahoo’s information security team learned that Russian
    hackers had stolen what the security team referred to internally as the company’s
    crown jewels: Usernames, email addresses, phone numbers, birth dates, encrypted
    passwords, and security questions and answers for hundreds of millions of user
    accounts. Although information relating to the breach was reported to members
    of Yahoo’s senior management and legal department, Yahoo failed to properly investigate
    the circumstances of the breach and to adequately consider whether the breach
    needed to be disclosed to investors. The fact of the breach was not disclosed

    did not share information regarding the breach with its auditors or outside counsel

    Finally, the SEC’s order found that Yahoo failed to maintain disclosure controls
