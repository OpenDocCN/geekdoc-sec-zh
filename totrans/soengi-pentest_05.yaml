    a level 1 merchant’s network (processing more than 6 million card transactions
    per year) and illegally extracting the payment card data stored within. The value
    of this extracted data, to the criminal, starts at approximately $4 per payment
    card record (sold on various illegal cyber chat rooms)—$24 million or used to
    purchase numerous goods, for sale on the black market (e.g., 6,000,000×$50 purchases—$300
    million worth of goods), sold at a discount of $30 each—$180 million.

    that although the concept of socially engineering individuals is understood, the
    various reasons for individuals being vulnerable are not necessarily so straightforward.
    The personnel can’t simply hear about social engineering and decide to avoid falling
    victim to it. While [Chapter 3](CHP003.xhtml) will discuss all the ways in which
    human nature can be exploited, this chapter will concentrate on vulnerabilities

  zh: “人是你安全体系中最薄弱的环节”这句话经常被安全专家使用。然而，企业继续忽视或忽略这个简单的概念。为了充分探讨这个观点，我们将以一个名为“弱点公司”的虚构企业为例。
- en: One morning Vulnerable Inc. personnel arrive to unlock the front doors to their
    office complex and raise the shutters. Upon entering, they then input the correct
    code to disable the main alarm. They climb the stairs to reach their main office
    and enter in yet another code to gain access to the electronic access control
    system. Therefore, every morning the personnel need to navigate through four layers
    of varied security controls, which would certainly be quite a challenge for an
    attacker. It is controls of this kind that receive the most significant investment
    from businesses.

  zh: 有一天早晨，弱点公司的人员来到办公大楼前解锁前门并升起百叶窗。进入后，他们输入正确的代码以停用主要警报。他们爬楼梯到达主要办公室，并再次输入代码以访问电子门禁系统。因此，每天早晨人员需要穿过四层不同的安全控制，这对攻击者来说肯定是一个相当大的挑战。这种控制是企业中最重要的投资之一。
- en: An attacker decides to break into the main offices of “Vulnerable Inc.” to steal
    laptops containing sensitive and valuable information. After a quick inspection
    of the various security controls they opt for climbing a ladder and gaining access
    through smashing a window. By doing so they immediately bypass three of the security
    controls, with only the main alarm remaining. This leaves them with a limited
    amount of time before anyone is likely to investigate the alarm noise to make
    a grab of a few laptops and various sensitive documents. In situations like this
    the usual response from the business is to invest more money in physical controls,
    which may well be very effective. Here the business may decide to install high
    security windows, install a closed-circuit television system, security furniture
    or some other mechanism to help prevent the attacker from breaking the windows
    and/or stealing laptops.

  zh: 一名攻击者决定闯入“易受攻击公司”的主要办公室，窃取包含敏感和有价值信息的笔记本电脑。在对各种安全控制进行快速检查后，他们选择爬梯子，通过砸破窗户进入。这样一来，他们立即绕过了三项安全控制，只剩下主警报系统。这让他们在任何人可能调查警报声之前有限的时间内，抓住几台笔记本电脑和各种敏感文件。在这种情况下，企业通常的反应是在物理控制上投入更多资金，这可能非常有效。在这里，企业可能决定安装高安全窗户，安装闭路电视系统，安全家具或其他机制，以帮助防止攻击者破坏窗户和/或窃取笔记本电脑。
- en: Now suppose the attacker wants to avoid raising any alarms, preferring to avoid
    the messy “smash and grab” approach. Instead they dress to match the employees,
    reproduce a fake employee badge and tailgate the personnel into the premises during
    a busy lunch-hour period, mirroring them by holding a supermarket shopping bag,
    just like everyone else. The attacker manages to casually walk past reception,
    blending in with all the other personnel. When no one is looking the attacker
    walks around the office placing various laptops into a bag, installs a few key
    loggers and grabs a few documents off a printer before making their way back out.
    All of this goes unnoticed until after lunch when people return to their desks
    to resume work, and even then it’s a mystery until someone suggests there may
    have been a theft. This scenario demonstrates an extremely simplistic example
    of a social engineering attack. They have not directly manipulated anyone or elicited
    any information from an employee. Instead they have created a plausible situation
    and have indirectly manipulated peoples’ perception. Onlookers believed the attacker
    to be a member of staff, validated by the badge, attire, confidence in their walk,
    shopping bag and from being merged in with the other personnel members. Attacks
    of this kind are extremely effective and the business may be hopelessly ill equipped
    to deal with them. The typical response to this kind of incident is to hastily
    deploy an ineffective company-wide security awareness program. That is, if there
    is any response initiated at all. This is understandable, bearing in mind that
    most companies may favor keeping an incident like this very quiet.

  zh: 现在假设攻击者想要避免引起任何警报，更倾向于避免混乱的“砸砸抢”方式。相反，他们打扮得与员工相匹配，复制一个假员工徽章，并在繁忙的午餐时间尾随员工进入场所，通过拿着一个超市购物袋，就像其他人一样。攻击者成功地漫不经心地走过接待处，与其他人员融为一体。当没有人注意时，攻击者在办公室四处走动，将各种笔记本电脑放入袋子中，安装几个键盘记录器，并从打印机上抓取一些文件，然后返回。所有这些直到午餐后人们回到他们的桌子继续工作时才被发现，即使在那时，直到有人提出可能发生了盗窃，这仍然是一个谜。这种情况展示了社会工程攻击的一个极其简单的例子。他们没有直接操纵任何人或从员工那里获取任何信息。相反，他们创造了一个似乎合理的情况，并间接操纵了人们的感知。旁观者相信攻击者是公司员工的一员，这一点通过徽章、服装、自信的步态、购物袋以及与其他人员融为一体来验证。这种攻击非常有效，企业可能毫无准备地应对这种情况。对这种事件的典型反应是匆忙部署一个无效的全公司安全意识计划。也就是说，如果有任何反应的话。这是可以理解的，考虑到大多数公司可能更倾向于保持这种事件非常低调。

    social engineering vulnerabilities are “intangible”, such as those associated
    with human nature or weak procedures. Most businesses are unfamiliar with the

    can probe for the service, they can see that it is available, but no matter how
    hard they try they cannot gain access to the data. Attacking this database directly

- en: When the perspective is shifted from the idea of attacking a system directly
    to attacking those who use it, the benefits become very interesting indeed. In

    their database credentials or allowing access to the database in some other way.
    However, although this may be the primary objective, it is not necessarily the
    best way of achieving it. For example, the attacker could try and trick the user
    into accessing the database on their behalf and reveal the information within,
    make changes to certain information or even delete sections. Rather than elicit
    the information required to gain access to the database directly, the user could
    become a puppet for interacting with that database. Providing the attacker’s pretext
    is good enough the user may perform this action without even realizing that they
    are causing a security breach. The attacker may achieve their objective without
    raising any alarms as a successful attack of this kind is very hard to detect

    e-mail sent to each head nurse. Any nurse that clicks the malicious link may unknowingly
    create a “back door” for the attacker, gaining access to the network. After escalating

    laptops in meeting rooms and various other places very useful, especially if they

    away too much information. A social engineer had called through, spoken to the
    employee and finished the call having learned the name, address and direct telephone
    number for the head of the IT department. Here the balance is too far toward availability
    and functionality, if you consider the help desk engineer to be a service rather
    than a person. The business could decide to restrict what the help desk engineers
    can and cannot say over the phone, perhaps by providing a script for them to use.
    This would reduce the “functionality” in order to increase security. The social
    engineer then calls through again, this time impersonating the head of IT and
    leverages their privileges to pressure the engineer into complying with their
    requests. The social engineer is successful in eliciting information that the
    employee knows they shouldn’t be revealing. The business then decides that the
    balance is clearly still not correct, so they implement a caller identification
    process whereby the caller is called back on a known number. This reduces availability
    to increase security. In response, the social engineer then impersonates an employee
    and claims that they are using a personal phone as their business phone is broken
    and bypasses the identification process. The business responds by implementing
    a hard and fast policy that only the known number can be used regardless of the
    situation. The employees are made aware that if they break or bend this policy
    they may be disciplined. This further reduces availability to increase the security.
    The adept social engineer now considers other possible solutions, such as tricking
    the phone company into diverting the calls or maybe just attacking the business
    in some other way. Now the business believes they have a good balance until a
    genuine personnel member calls up with an urgent situation using their personal
    phone, having actually broken their business one. For that personnel member the
    balance certainly isn’t right at all as they hopelessly argue with a help desk
    engineer that refuses to help them.

    characters. It is believed that this will significantly improve the overall security
    of the business. However, the availability is considered nonexistent to a user
    that can’t remember their new complex password. Consequently, that user then decides
    to write down the new complex password in case they forget it again. Suddenly
    the password security policy is rendered completely useless. Social engineers
    are fully aware of issues such as this and will often look for information such
    as passwords written down around the office (such as on small Post-It notes, calendars,
    diaries, etc.).

    but got cut off and he can’t remember their name. The employee can easily solve
    this and using an obvious trick reveals the full name. By stressing the importance
    of the conversation, the social engineer applies a slight pressure on the employee.
    The social engineer is not directly asking for the person’s name, they are presenting
    a problem with a solution involving the name. There is a big difference between
    the two in the mind of the help desk employee. Finally, the direct dial is gained
    by presenting a second problem. They keep getting cut off so would like the convenience
    of being able to dial back directly. Again, this problem is easily resolved. The
    social engineer then adds in a hint about the nature of call, being about a colleague.
    This would hopefully create a sense of curiosity in the help desk employee, increasing
    the potential for them being helpful. By presenting problems rather than asking
    directly for information, the social engineer takes advantage of the customer
    service mentality. This customer service vulnerability will exist wherever the
    social engineer can achieve their objective through the solution to a problem
    that personnel can solve.

    help to defend against social engineering as the hard-faced grumpy and stubborn
    receptionist would likely refuse to give out any information, probably out of
    spite rather than due to procedures. However, your business would quickly suffer
    from the tirade of negative customer feedback.

    The simple fact is, if you don’t have management support then your project is
    more than likely doomed to failure. What happens when management do not appreciate
    the threat of social engineering? Does this make the company more susceptible
    to it? The short answer is obviously “yes”! Without management “buy in” there
    will be little if any budget for defensive strategies and the employees are unlikely
    to support a concept that doesn’t have management support. Without robust policies
    and procedures, personnel awareness and training and security assessments, the
    business leaves itself open to attack.

    when it doesn’t suit them and possibly refuse to attend awareness and training
    programs on the grounds that it doesn’t apply to them. The management’s position
    makes them a possible target for impersonation techniques and if management consistently
    bypass security controls, then the social engineers can do the same. It is hugely
    important that management set a good example for the employees.

    A very clichéd social engineering attack is to turn up to the business claiming
    to have a meeting with the employee you know is away. This can be useful to perhaps
    drop USB drives with malicious software (hoping that employees will pick them

    David visited you today, could I ask how the meeting went?*” From the manager’s
    perspective the caller must be genuine or else how else could they possibly know
    about the meeting? To get any of the above information the social engineer obviously
    needs to get to the stage of signing in. However, they could simply write down
    false information and provide a contact they know isn’t there. When the receptionist

    the RFID signal using specialist equipment. As above, when and if the validation

    a very plausible situation, looked right and sounded convincing, the receptionist
    may well accept the social engineer’s reasoning for dismissing the procedure.
    In fact, in the face of not knowing what to do, accepting the social engineer’s
    reasoning will likely be a tempting solution to the problem. The social engineer
    may explain that they’d already spoken to their manager Helen and she said it
    would be fine to be unescorted, knowing full well that Helen is away on business

    defensive strategies. Some of the most common security challenges that businesses

    and many would argue that employees are inherently vulnerable, posing the greatest
    risk to the business. However, this chapter has shown this is not necessarily
    the whole story. Business security issues such as granting excessive privileges,
    ineffective data classification, lack of need to know, weak policies, weak procedures
    and even poor management example contribute significantly to the employees’ susceptibility
    to social engineering. Some of the more difficult challenges such as balancing
    security, functionality and availability have shown that businesses are often
    facing an uphill battle.

- en: '[Chapter 3](CHP003.xhtml) focuses on the vulnerabilities in human nature, rather
    than those within the structure of the business. These are the vulnerabilities
    most commonly associated with social engineering. The chapter will cover the basic
    techniques such as pretexting and impersonation, then build on these to explore
    more advanced topics such as information aggregation, leveraging emotional states
    and target personality profiling. Each concept will be discussed both in terms
    of general social engineering and in relation to how they might be used during
    assessments.'
