<h1 data-number="1"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction</h1>
<p>Compilers, assemblers and similar tools generate all the binary code that processors execute. It is no surprise then that these tools play a major role in security analysis and hardening of relevant binary code.</p>
<p>Often the only practical way to protect all binaries with a particular security hardening method is to have the compiler do it. And, with software security becoming more and more important in recent years, it is no surprise to see an ever increasing variety of security hardening features and mitigations against vulnerabilities implemented in compilers. Indeed, compared to a few decades ago, today’s compiler developer is much more likely to implement security features than not.</p>
<p>Furthermore, with the ever-expanding range of techniques implemented, it’s very hard to gain a basic understanding of all security features implemented in typical compilers.</p>
<p>This poses a practical problem: compiler developers must be able to work on security hardening features, yet it’s hard to gain a good, basic understanding of such compiler features.</p>
<p>There are a lot of materials that explain individual vulnerabilities or attack vectors. There are also lots of presentations explaining specific exploits. But there seems to be a limited set of materials that give a structured overview of all vulnerabilities and exploits against which a code generator plays a role in protecting.</p>
<p>This book aims to provide such a structured, broad overview. It does not necessarily go into full details, instead aiming to give a thorough description of all relevant high-level aspects of attacks, vulnerabilities, mitigations, and hardening techniques. For further details, this book provides pointers to materials with more details on specific techniques.</p>
<p>The purpose of this book is to serve as a guide to every compiler developer that needs to learn about software security relevant to compilers. Even though the focus is on compiler developers, we expect that this book will also be useful to people working on other low-level software.</p>
<section id="why-an-open-source-book" class="level2" data-number="1.1">
<h2 data-number="1.1"><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Why an open source book?</h2>
<p>The idea for this book emerged out of a frustration of not finding a good overview on this topic. Kristof Beyls and Georgia Kouveli, both compiler engineers working on security features, wished a book like this would exist. After not finding such a book, they decided to try and write one themselves. They immediately realized that they do not have all necessary expertise themselves to complete such a daunting task. So they decided to try and create this book in an open source style, seeking contributions from many experts.</p>
<p>As you read this, the book remains unfinished. This book may well never be finished, as new vulnerabilities continue to be discovered regularly. Our hope is that developing the book as an open source project will allow for it to continue to evolve and improve. The open source development process of this book increases the likelihood that it remains relevant as new vulnerabilities and mitigations emerge.</p>
<p>Kristof and Georgia, the initial authors, are far from experts on all possible vulnerabilities. So what is the plan to get high quality content to cover all relevant topics? It is two-fold.</p>
<p>First, by studying specific topics, they hope to gain enough knowledge to write up a good summary for this book.</p>
<p>Second, they very much invite and welcome contributions. If you’re interested in potentially contributing content, please go to the home location for the open source project at <a href="https://github.com/llsoftsec/llsoftsecbook" class="uri">https://github.com/llsoftsec/llsoftsecbook</a>.</p>
<p>As this book is very much a work in progress, you will notice plenty of “TODO” items throughout this book. <span class="todo">This is an example “TODO” item</span></p>
<p>We think that keeping the TODOs clearly visible helps both readers and potential contributors. Readers get hints of what kind of further content is still missing. Potential contributors get hints for where we need help to further improve this book.</p>
<p>As a reader, you can also contribute to making this book better. We highly encourage feedback, both positive and constructive criticisms. We prefer feedback through either <a href="https://github.com/llsoftsec/llsoftsecbook" class="uri">https://github.com/llsoftsec/llsoftsecbook</a>, for example by raising an issue there, or through our <a href="https://discord.gg/Bm55Z9Ppgn">Discord server</a>. Interested potential contributors can reach the LLSoftSec community through the same channels.</p>
