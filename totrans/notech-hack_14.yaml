- en: If you’re responsible for defending against the bad guy versions of no-tech
    hackers like me, you’ll need to develop some of the same awareness. A no-tech
    hacker will spot that sensitive document laying out in public, unless you spot
    it first. A no-tech hacker will notice the ineffective lock on the “To Be Shredded”
    bin, unless you notice it first. Even though you never heard a whistle blow, the
    game is already in progress. Are you ready to match wits with a malicious, highly
    motivated foe? If not, read on - and get off the bench, before it’s “Game Over.”

    can be done to keep them at bay. Presented in no particular order, here are the
    ten best ways to shut down no-tech hackers.

    it safe.” Don’t work on private stuff in public spaces, and don’t make yourself
    a target. Be aware of the profile you present, and tone it down if necessary.
    If you’ve got to work on private stuff in public, consider a laptop privacy filter.
    Of course bear in mind that an experienced shoulder surfer will see a privacy
    filter and rightly assume you’re working on something sensitive. Because of this,
    the mere existence of a filter can make you or your machine a target. Did I mention
    leaving the private stuff out of public spaces? That’s your best bet.'

    flying the team colors is a bad idea. Depending on current events, the political
    climate or other factors anyone can become a target of public scrutiny or unwanted
    attention. Government agencies have requested for years that employees travel
    low profile, but those same agencies still produce signature items sporting the
    agency logo. The best advice I can offer you is to play it smart. Take a moment
    to consider your profile, and every now and then play it paranoid. A no-tech hacker
    may be the least of your worries.'

    from too-curious eyes.'

    watering hole or food trough. So, don’t fill their all-too-eager ears with company
    jargon and secrets.'

- en: The golden rule is to shred everything. But shredding is a subjective word.
    There are lots of varieties of shredders, each of which provides a different level
    of security. While a basic shredder that churns out 3/8” strip seems decent enough,
    it’s trivial to reassemble the pieces. Obliterating your docs with a particle
    shredder is nice, but those things are pretty expensive, and unless you’re truly
    evil (or paranoid), it’s just overkill.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A decent “micro-cut” shredder from an office supply store will cost around $200,
    and can cut paper, CD’s and even credit cards into 3/32 x 5/16 pieces, for better
    than average security. Generally speaking, you’ll get what you pay for. But whatever
    you choose anything’s better that putting documents in the trash in one piece,
    or laying them in the parking lot.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It’s also a great idea to get to know what’s in your trash before the bad guys
    do. If you’re in charge of security for your company, consider at least a weekly
    visit to your dumpster to get a feel for what’s being tossed and what condition
    it’s in when it lands in the big green box. If you’re a consumer looking to protect
    your privacy, get a personal shredder and have a discussion with your family members
    about what should be shredded before being thrown away. If your family refuses
    to comply, you might consider relocating them.

    should always keep your keys out of sight of the bad guys. Barry Wels of The Open
    Organization of Lockpickers (Toool) reminds us that professionals can “read” a
    key just by looking at it, giving him a head start on either duplicating the key
    or picking the lock it was made for. He even reports to have heard rumors that
    “surveillance teams try to make photographs of keys visibly worn by suspects to
    give the NDE (non-destructive operator) a head start… .” He goes on to say in
    his blog at [www.toool.nl/blackbag](http://www.toool.nl/blackbag) that some prison
    guards “carry keys in a way the inmates can not see them.” One solution is to
    consider a customized key carrying device like a “key port” from [www.key-port.com](http://www.key-port.com),
    which conceals the keys from view, but makes them simple to take out when they
    are needed.

    wear company logos and remove extraneous markings and information from your mobile

    turn off your monitor) if you think you’re a target and become suddenly (and obviously)
    interested in something else, like sipping your coffee. Most no-tech hackers will
    know they’ve been busted and move along. If they do bail, keep a casual eye on
    them as they leave and try to get a good look at them and their car/bike/skateboard/Segway
    before they bail. When they’ve cleared out take a look at what you were working
    on, consider all of it compromised, and act accordingly. If your surfer doesn’t
    bail after you close your lid, keep an eye on him or her anyhow. If he or she
    continues acting suspiciously, do something about it. Inform a manager, security
    guard or hall monitor. Do *something.* If that something involves physical violence,
    just don’t tell the judge it was my idea.'

    specific individuals. P2P hacking is about finding interesting information based
    on specific keywords. If a hacker’s after you, he or she is probably not going
    to log into a P2P client in search of your information because this makes the
    assumption that you’re running a P2P client *and* that you have shared personal
    data there. Both of these are rather wild assumptions. So if you do run P2P software,
    make sure you know exactly what it is you are sharing, and then make sure your

    hackers. Googling yourself is never a bad idea, but remember that Googling an
    entire credit card number or all the digits of your social security number is
    a bad idea—the search term itself then becomes private data. Instead, search for
    your name and address, or a portion of your name along with a portion of a sensitive
    number. Better yet, use the *numrange* operator to search for your name along
    with a range of numbers *around* those sensitive digits. For more on advanced
