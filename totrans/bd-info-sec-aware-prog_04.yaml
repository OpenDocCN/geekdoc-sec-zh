- en: Not all attacks are technical. Now that we have built technical defenses around
    our networks, social engineering is used in the majority of recent breaches. The
    only defense against social engineering is an engaging security awareness program.
    A security awareness program helps with the development and enforcement of policies
    while at the same time helping to set the limits of what is acceptable and what
    is not acceptable behavior by the users of an organization's computer and telecommunication
    services. A security awareness program helps to limit risks of breaches to an
    organization's sensitive and confidential data. A security awareness program is
    defined as a formal program with the goal of training users of potential threats
    to an organization's information and how to avoid situations that might put the
    organization's data at risk.

    of the potential threats to an organization's information and how to avoid situations
    that might put the organization's data at risk.

- en: The goals of the security awareness program are to lower the organization's
    attack surface, to empower users to take personal responsibility for protecting
    the organization's information, and to enforce the policies and procedures the
    organization has in place to protect its data. Policies and procedures might include
    but are not limited to computer use policies, Internet use policies, remote access
    policies, and other policies that aim to govern and protect the organization's
    data.

    People want to do a good job. People want to give good customer service to their
    coworkers, clients, and vendors. People are curious. Social engineers seek to
    exploit these characteristics in humans. “Social Engineering is defined as the
    process of deceiving people into giving away access or confidential information”
    [[1](#bb0010)]. The only known defense for social engineering attacks is an effective
    security awareness program. Unless users understand the tactics and techniques
    of social engineers, they will fall prey and put the organization's data at risk.

    of exploiting humans. One example is the RSA breach [[2](#bb0015)] where sophisticated
    attackers used targeted spear phishing to steal RSA SecurID authentication tokens
    that lead to a further breach at US defense contractor Lockheed Martin [[3](#bb0020)].
    Another example is the “Aurora” attack against Google and other large software
    companies that used an attack that sent users to a website that infected users
    with a cutting-edge 0day exploit. The result was that a large amount of intellectual
    property including source code was stolen from companies including Google and
    Adobe [[4](#bb0025)].

    go around the firewall. Organizations have spent billions of dollars developing
    layered defenses against online attackers. There are solutions such as antivirus,
    intrusion detection systems, intrusion prevention systems, and other technical
    solutions to protect information. With these sophisticated solutions in place,
    attackers are now turning to more targeted attacks focused on tricking users into
    clicking links or opening attachments.

    engineer attacks such as website, attachment, human interface device (HID), and
    QR attacks for defenders to use to test their own environments [[5](#bb0030)].
    This might sound simplistic, but what would most users do if they received an
    attachment that appears to come from the HR department that appears to be a spreadsheet
    of raises for everyone in the organization ([Figure 1.1](#f0010))? Curiosity might
    not just kill the cat; it might also put your data at risk.

- en: While SET is a technical tool, its goal is to use nontechnical means to exploit
    humans who in turn exploit computers, which leads to data compromise [[6](#bb0035)].
    SET can easily clone a website to an attacker's machine where exploits are then
    inserted into the website. At that point, the attacker will attempt to direct
    users to the cloned site. This might be accomplished by spear phishing, sending
    the user linked disguised by a link-shortening service or buying a domain to host
    the cloned site that looks legitimate. Once the user is on the cloned site, the
    attacker can use a number of different attack vectors to steal information or
    install backdoors to allow the attack to access the system as if the attacker
    was a legitimate user. SET also has the ability to encode these attacks, so they
    are not detected by antivirus and other software used to detect malware and intrusions.
    The credential harvester attack is accomplished through SET by cloning a site
    like Twitter, Facebook, or even a bank or credit card site with a username and
    password file. When the user attempts to log into the site, SET steals the username
    and password and logs the user into the legitimate website. We will discuss SET
    in more detail later in the book.

    Policies and procedures are the first building blocks. The next layer is a security
    awareness program, also called user awareness training. Only when these two elements
    are in place do we then move to the next steps of patch management, log management,
    antivirus/HIDS, security appliances, and finally metrics. For years, organizations
    have thrown money at security, when that money would have been better spent training
    their users ([Figure 1.2](#f0015)). The focus of this book is building a security
    awareness program step by step with the ultimate goal of building a mature security
    program.

    users. Depending on the size of the organization, these policies can be a number
    of documents addressing specific divisions of the organization's IT and HR structure,
    or it might in the case of smaller organizations be one single document that outlines
    the limitations and duties of those who use the organization's telephone, computer,
    e-mail, and other digital assets.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The most common policy is the computer use policy. Other separate policies that
    can be addressed in a separate document are e-mail usage, Internet usage, telephone
    usage, and fax usage. Computer use, also sometimes called acceptable use policy,
    defines the user's level of access to computer and telecommunication resources
    and their rights and limitation as to the use of those resources. The biggest
    goal of the acceptable use is to define where use ends and abuse begins. For example,
    it would be deemed an abuse in most organizations if user spends work time accessing
    porn and gambling sites. It would also be considered abuse if employees use phone
    and e-mail services for excessive personal communication during the workday. Most
    organizations understand that some personal use is necessary and the acceptable
    use policy to define what constitutes what is acceptable and what is not acceptable
    use of the organization's equipment and services.

    [[7](#bb0040)]. While these sorts of templates are useful, it is important to
    remember that they need to be customized to define the needs and missions of your
    organization.

- en: The organization's human resources department also needs to be involved. In
    many cases, specific portions of the policies will have penalties that will be
    enforced by HR. In most cases, policies and procedure will have to be developed
    with regulations in mind. Those organizations that handle health data are likely
    to be covered by HIPAA/HITECH. Organizations that handle credit card transactions
    are likely to be covered by PCI DSS. Specifically, the HIPAA/HITECH physical standards
    of the security rule address issues including workstation use, 164.310(b); workstation
    security, 164.310(c); and device and media controls, 164.310(d)(1). HIPAA/HITECH
    also calls for punishing those who don't follow policies under the administrative
    standards of the security rule, specifically authorizations and/or supervision,
    workforce clearance procedure, and termination procedures, 164.308(a)(3).

    first step, but most of the time, the users will not spend the time to read the

    especially the policies that apply to the use, abuse, and penalties for the abuse
    of the organization's communication and information technology infrastructure.

    of dollars depending on the size of the breach. Additionally, many states now
    have breach notification laws that require organizations that lose data to inform
    those affected as to what was lost and in some cases provide credit protection
    to those affected. Ponemon Institute and Symantec released a report in June of

    getting the approval and support of the management structure of the organizations.
    Without managerial support, policies will go unwritten, policies will go unenforced,
    and management and employees will rebel against any structure, rules, or limitations
    being put on them in regard to securing the organization's information. Even in
    the face of regulations such as HIPAA/HITECH and PCI DSS, without support from
    the management of the organizations, security awareness indicatives will fail.

    how a security awareness program will help them manage that risk. The second step

    production increases.

    industry. For example, if your organization is a law firm, use case studies and
    examples of lawyers and law firms that have been breached because of mistakes
    made by users. It is also important to illustrate the cunningness of attackers.
    Most people think of everyday nontargeted virus infections when they think of
    security, when the most dangerous attackers are technically advanced hackers looking

    such changes will get in the way of the business goals of the organization. Properly
    communicating with management in nontechnical terms is key to getting management
    buy-in. When managers from the top down understand the purposes and goals of a
    security awareness program and that such a program is in line with the business
    goals of the organization, mainly making money, they will be more receptive to
    implementing a security awareness program.

    the focus of this book is to empower the reason to build their own program within
    their own organizations whether those organizations are small, medium, or large
    businesses or corporations or if they are nonprofit groups or even schools. Most
    of this information will also be useable by home users to better manage their
    risk when facing online threats, but home users are beyond the scope of this book.
