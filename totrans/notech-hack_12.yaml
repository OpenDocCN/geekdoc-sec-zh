    takes, slick editing and a monster budget, all to create something thrilling,
    but fake. What most people don’t realize that some of the most thrilling vehicular
    espionage happens when the cars aren’t moving at all?

    strolling around, I notice vehicles. I’m not like a car nut who enjoys interesting,
    old, or exotic cars, but I get a certain (odd) thrill out of building a profile
    of the driver by looking at their car. No-tech hackers are really good at this,
    and in this chapter, I’ll give you an idea of what they look for. Check out the
    next photo. What can you tell me about the driver?

    of every panel and window, there’s a metal plate (shown below) that spells out
    exactly what kind of vehicle this is, and what line of work the driver’s in.

    right, and you might just have a knack for vehicle surveillance. Taking the next
    logic jump, it’s safe to assume the driver’s either a police officer or he just
    jacked an officer’s ride.

    driver of this vehicle *does* for a living, but what would a no-tech hacker consider
    doing with this information?

    sporting the right logo, I could be the “Acme” Bank Security & Vault Services
    guy, ready to work on this company’s safes, vaults, pneumatic systems or alarm
    systems (not that a hacker would be at all interested in those things). Let’s
    try another exercise. Take a look at the next photo.

    know right away that this was the parking lot of a Kohl’s department store and
    they would hang an immediate left, drawn in by the “biggest sale of the season”
    which just so happens to run every other week. A book weenie (like me) would recognize
    the Barnes and Noble bookstore across the parking lot. A no-tech hacker would
    immediately think “fed”—slang for *federal agent,* a term used to identify federal
    government employees. How would he realize this? Can you tell from the above photo?
    If you can’t quite tell, take a look at the next photo, which highlights the “fed’s”
    vehicle.

    owned by a government employee, and he or she would also know approximately where
    that employee reported for work. All of this information and more can be gleaned
    from the vehicle permit stuck on the window, like the one shown below.

    I was tempted to follow this car so I could find out exactly what a “surf war”
    looked like. It would certainly give new meaning to “shooting the curl.” Government
    employees aren’t the only ones eyeballed by no-tech hackers. A quick glance at
    the Volvo in the next photo reveals either where the owner works or lives. Can
    you tell how?

    can use simple deduction to realize that the address is probably close to where
    the owner works or lives. If the vehicle is parked in a work parking lot, and
    the address isn’t local, it probably is near their home. Most people won’t get
    an oil change somewhere that’s out of the way of their normal commute.

    how long he or she has lived in San Francisco is pretty straightforward, considering
    the first parking permit expired in July of 2000\. Figuring out where the driver
    lives in San Francisco take a bit of creativity. However, Google is a no-tech
    hacker’s friend. A quick search for *San Francisco residential parking permit
    map* leads us to a handy PDF map, a portion of which is shown below.

    approximate area where the driver lives. The next photo is quite similar, and
    can be used to deduce the same information, but in this case, a no-tech hacker
    can also determine where the driver lived previously and when they moved. Can
    you?

    residential permit area *“A”* to residential permit area *“C”* sometime between
    February and June of 2004\. Using the map we Googled above, we can get a good
    idea of exactly where both residential permit areas are in San Francisco.

    many other things we could use to deduce information using only exterior clues,
    some of the best stuff is often sitting inside a vehicle in plain site of anyone
    passing by–like the receipt in the next photo. Although I had to fiddle with the
    zoom on my crappy camera to capture the document instead of the raindrops on the
    window, I think the photo came out quite nicely.

    (presumably the driver’s) name and insurance company, a list of services performed
    on that particular date, and what the charges were for those services. Most people
    guard their medical information very closely, but I’m constantly surprised by
    how often I see information like this out in the open.

    gross pay, tax information and more. The most valuable piece of information, in
    my opinion, is the revelation of the last four digits of the employee’s social
    security number, which is used as a security question by most automated identity
    verification systems. Armed with this information, I could easily establish credit
    in this person’s name or steal their identity completely.

    be a thriving criminal business.

    this credit card could easily be used to make purchases from any vendor that doesn’t
    abide by rather strict credit card screening procedures, and many of them do not.
    If you’ve got your medical records, bank statement or credit cards sitting on
    your front seat, there’s a good chance a no-tech hacker will have seen it before
    you get around to removing it. As I’ve said in other chapters, the key to protecting
    yourself is to remain vigilant, and try to see life through the eyes of a no-tech
    hacker. Check out the Epilogue for more good advice.
