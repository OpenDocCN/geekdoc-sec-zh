    encryption** (where a single **secret key** is used to encrypt and decrypt data)
    and **asymmetric encryption** (where a public key cryptosystem is used and encryption
    and decryption is done using a **pair of public and corresponding private key**).
    Let''s explain these fundamental crypto-concepts in details.'

- en: 'Symmetric encryption usually combines several crypto algorithms into an **symmetric
    encryption scheme**, e.g. AES-256-CTR-HMAC-SHA256\. The **encryption scheme**
    (cipher construction) may include: password to **key derivation** algorithm (with
    certain parameters) + **symmetric cipher** algorithm (with certain parameters)
    + **cipher block mode** algorithm + **message authentication** (MAC) algorithm.
    This means that **the above shown diagram is simplified** and does not fully represent
    the process.'

    is typically of size 128, 192 or 256 bits and is sometimes referred as "***encryption
