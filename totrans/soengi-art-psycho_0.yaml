- en: Nowadays, a huge number of people have become too acquainted with hackers who
    exploit sensitive data and protected computer systems of various organizations,
    including banks, businesses, and even government agencies.  More often than not,
    you will hear about hackers and become motivated to forestall their ploys.  Most
    organizations counter the exploits of hackers through investments in new and up-to-date
    technologies to strengthen their defenses.

- en: On the other hand, there is a new breed of attackers who use their expertise
    to go past the solutions and tools of organizations.  This new breed of attackers
    is referred to as social engineers, who are likewise known as hackers; however,
    their primary objective is to tap into one's weakness, that is, human psychology. 
    Social engineers make use of media such as phone calls as well as social media
    to trick people so that they can gain access to important and sensitive information.

    executed in various ways such as pretexting, phishing, quid pro quo, baiting,
    and tailgating among others.

- en: Pretexting is a form of social engineering in which attackers create a fabricated
    situation or good pretext, which they use to steal one's personal information. 
    More often than not, attackers who use pretexting are mistaken as scammers who
    usually pretend that they need personal information for confirming their target's
    identity.

- en: Attackers who have advanced skills in social engineering using pretexting try
    to persuade their targets to do certain actions in order to gain access to an
    organization and exploit its structural flaws.  For instance, an attacker may
    take the form of an external IT services auditor to try and manipulate the physical
    security staff of an organization so that he/she can gain access to the building.

- en: Social engineering attacks via pretexting depend on the creation of a delusive
    sense of trust with the target.  The attacker is required to create a credible
    story, leaving little or no room for doubt on his/her target; thus, the attacker
    can gain information that is both sensitive and non-sensitive.  There was a case
    wherein a group of attackers took the form of modeling agency representatives
    and invented fabricated stories as well as interview questions.  The attackers
    targeted women whom they manipulated to sending nude photos of themselves.

- en: Phishing is considered as the most common type of social engineering, which
    attackers use today.  Phishing scams have distinct characteristics such as obtaining
    personal information, including names, social security numbers, and addresses
    of targets; incorporating fear, a sense of urgency, and threats to manipulate
    targets to act fast; and using embed links or link shorteners to redirect targets
    to suspicious websites through URLs that may appear authorized or legit.

- en: Although some phishing emails are crafted poorly, that is, the messages include
    grammatical errors and misspelled words, they can still direct targets to fake
    websites.  Phishing emails are intended to steal the login credentials and other
    personal information of targets.

- en: More often than not, attackers who use phishing emails pair malware with their
    phishing ploys in order to obtain users' information.  For instance, a reported
    scam involved attackers who sent phishing emails to targets.  The targets were
    prompted to install cracked APK files from Google Play Books.  However, the files
    were already pre-loaded with malware.

- en: Quid pro quo is another form of social engineering.  It involves a promise from
    the attackers that the target will receive a benefit in exchange for a particular
    piece of information.  The benefit that attackers promise their targets is in
    the form of services instead of goods.

- en: More often than not, attackers who use quid pro quo ploys pose as fraudsters
    who act as people for IT services.  The attackers usually make as many spam calls
    as possible to direct numbers from an organization and offer their targets IT
    assistance.  They will then promise a quick fix of a certain IT issue while prompting
    their targets to disable their AV program.  Once the targets agree, the fraudsters
    install malware that take the form of software updates on the computers of their
    targets.

- en: There are also cases wherein attackers use less sophisticated ploys of quid
    pro quo.  For instance, attackers know that many people, specifically office workers,
    would be willing to share their passwords in exchange for a bar of chocolate or
    even a cheap pen.

- en: Another form of social engineering is baiting, which is similar to phishing
    and quid pro quo in many ways.  Attackers who use baiting employ online schemes
    that entice their targets to surrender their login credentials to a suspicious
    website in exchange for a good or an item.  More often than not, attackers offer
    their targets with free movie or music downloads.

- en: However, baiting is not limited to online schemes.  Attackers who use this type
    of social engineering can also exploit the human curiosity through physical media. 
    There was a case in which a founder of an organization along with his team infected
    and dispersed a number of USBs with a Trojan virus around the parking lot of his
    organization.  Most of the employees picked up and plugged the USBs into their
    gadgets such as computers, laptops, and tablets out of curiosity.  Once they plugged
    the USBs, a keylogger was activated and the founder was able to access the login
    credentials of his employees.

- en: Tailgating, also known as “piggybacking,” is a social engineering form that
    involves attackers who have no proper authentication in an organization.  The
    attackers follow employees to obtain access in a restricted area.

- en: A tailgating attack often involves attackers who pose as delivery drivers waiting
    at an organization's parking lot.  When the attackers see an employee gaining
    the security's approval, the attackers who usually carry “goods for delivery”
    ask the employee to hold the door.  Thus, they gain access from someone who is
    authorized to get into the building.

- en: Social engineers often use tailgating in small organizations or companies given
    that most large companies require employees to swipe their identification cards. 
    However, in the case of small to mid-sized companies, attackers can easily converse
    with employees to show the security a sense of familiarity, getting past the latter
    as well as the front desk.

- en: A known security consultant used tailgating to access into several floors of
    a building, including one that housed the data room of a financial firm.  The
    consultant was able to access the building's third floor meeting room wherein
    he worked for a few days in order to obtain information.

    threat to various organizations.  Social engineering can cost targets thousands,
    if not, millions of dollars annually as it attacks people with access or knowledge
    to an organization's sensitive information.  Today, most attackers leverage various
    tactics and social networking schemes in order to obtain professional and personal
    information of their targets.  The people who are most susceptible to social engineering
    attackers are the new employees, followed by contractors, human resources, executive
    assistants, IT personnel, and business leaders.

    to counter social engineering.  In addition, there are organizations who do not
    have security policies or employee training that prevent tactics of social engineering.

    chapter, you will learn what social engineering is and what social engineers want
    as well as the different ploys that attackers use.  The second chapter of this
    book offers pertinent information on the basic psychological tactics that attackers
    use to implement their social engineering schemes.
