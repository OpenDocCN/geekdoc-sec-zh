  zh: 介绍
- en: Nowadays, a huge number of people have become too acquainted with hackers who
    exploit sensitive data and protected computer systems of various organizations,
    including banks, businesses, and even government agencies.  More often than not,
    you will hear about hackers and become motivated to forestall their ploys.  Most
    organizations counter the exploits of hackers through investments in new and up-to-date
    technologies to strengthen their defenses.

  zh: 如今，大量的人已经对利用敏感数据和各种组织（包括银行、企业甚至政府机构）受保护的计算机系统的黑客非常熟悉。 往往，您会听说黑客并受到激励以防范他们的策略。
    大多数组织通过投资于新的和最新的技术来加强其防御来抵御黑客的攻击。
- en: On the other hand, there is a new breed of attackers who use their expertise
    to go past the solutions and tools of organizations.  This new breed of attackers
    is referred to as social engineers, who are likewise known as hackers; however,
    their primary objective is to tap into one's weakness, that is, human psychology. 
    Social engineers make use of media such as phone calls as well as social media
    to trick people so that they can gain access to important and sensitive information.

  zh: 另一方面，有一种新型攻击者利用其专业知识超越组织的解决方案和工具。 这种新型攻击者被称为社会工程师，也被称为黑客； 但是，他们的主要目标是利用人类心理的弱点。
    社会工程师利用电话呼叫和社交媒体等媒介来欺骗人们，以便他们可以获取重要和敏感信息。
- en: Social engineering involves a wide range of malicious activities, which are
    executed in various ways such as pretexting, phishing, quid pro quo, baiting,
    and tailgating among others.

  zh: 社会工程学涉及一系列恶意活动，以各种方式执行，例如预文化、钓鱼、以点还点、诱饵和尾随等。
- en: Pretexting is a form of social engineering in which attackers create a fabricated
    situation or good pretext, which they use to steal one's personal information. 
    More often than not, attackers who use pretexting are mistaken as scammers who
    usually pretend that they need personal information for confirming their target's
    identity.

  zh: 预文化是一种社会工程，攻击者在其中创造了一个虚假的情景或好的借口，用以窃取个人信息。 往往，使用预文化的攻击者被误认为是需要个人信息来确认其目标身份的骗子。
- en: Attackers who have advanced skills in social engineering using pretexting try
    to persuade their targets to do certain actions in order to gain access to an
    organization and exploit its structural flaws.  For instance, an attacker may
    take the form of an external IT services auditor to try and manipulate the physical
    security staff of an organization so that he/she can gain access to the building.

  zh: 具有高级社会工程技能的攻击者试图说服其目标执行某些操作，以获取对组织的访问权并利用其结构缺陷。 例如，攻击者可能扮成外部IT服务审计员，试图操纵组织的物理安全人员，以便他/她可以进入建筑物。
- en: Social engineering attacks via pretexting depend on the creation of a delusive
    sense of trust with the target.  The attacker is required to create a credible
    story, leaving little or no room for doubt on his/her target; thus, the attacker
    can gain information that is both sensitive and non-sensitive.  There was a case
    wherein a group of attackers took the form of modeling agency representatives
    and invented fabricated stories as well as interview questions.  The attackers
    targeted women whom they manipulated to sending nude photos of themselves.

  zh: 社会工程攻击通过预文化依赖于与目标建立一种虚假的信任感。 攻击者需要编造一个可信的故事，让他/她的目标几乎没有怀疑的余地； 因此，攻击者可以获取既敏感又非敏感的信息。
    有一个案例，一群攻击者扮成模特经纪人并编造了捏造的故事以及面试问题。 攻击者针对的是那些被操纵发送裸照的女性。
- en: Phishing is considered as the most common type of social engineering, which
    attackers use today.  Phishing scams have distinct characteristics such as obtaining
    personal information, including names, social security numbers, and addresses
    of targets; incorporating fear, a sense of urgency, and threats to manipulate
    targets to act fast; and using embed links or link shorteners to redirect targets
    to suspicious websites through URLs that may appear authorized or legit.

  zh: 钓鱼被认为是当今攻击者最常用的一种社会工程类型。 钓鱼诈骗具有明显的特征，例如获取目标的个人信息，包括姓名、社会安全号码和地址； 利用恐惧、紧迫感和威胁来操纵目标迅速行动；
    并使用嵌入式链接或链接缩短器通过看似授权或合法的URL将目标重定向到可疑网站。
- en: Although some phishing emails are crafted poorly, that is, the messages include
    grammatical errors and misspelled words, they can still direct targets to fake
    websites.  Phishing emails are intended to steal the login credentials and other
    personal information of targets.

  zh: 尽管一些网络钓鱼邮件制作得很差，即消息包含语法错误和拼写错误，它们仍然可以将目标引导到假网站。网络钓鱼邮件旨在窃取目标的登录凭据和其他个人信息。
- en: More often than not, attackers who use phishing emails pair malware with their
    phishing ploys in order to obtain users' information.  For instance, a reported
    scam involved attackers who sent phishing emails to targets.  The targets were
    prompted to install cracked APK files from Google Play Books.  However, the files
    were already pre-loaded with malware.

  zh: 往往，利用网络钓鱼邮件的攻击者将恶意软件与他们的网络钓鱼计划配对，以获取用户的信息。例如，有报道称，攻击者向目标发送了网络钓鱼邮件。目标被提示从Google
    Play Books安装破解的APK文件。然而，这些文件已经预先加载了恶意软件。
- en: Quid pro quo is another form of social engineering.  It involves a promise from
    the attackers that the target will receive a benefit in exchange for a particular
    piece of information.  The benefit that attackers promise their targets is in
    the form of services instead of goods.

  zh: 交换条件是社会工程学的另一种形式。它涉及攻击者向目标承诺，目标将收到一项利益，以换取特定的信息。攻击者向目标承诺的利益是以服务而不是商品的形式出现的。
- en: More often than not, attackers who use quid pro quo ploys pose as fraudsters
    who act as people for IT services.  The attackers usually make as many spam calls
    as possible to direct numbers from an organization and offer their targets IT
    assistance.  They will then promise a quick fix of a certain IT issue while prompting
    their targets to disable their AV program.  Once the targets agree, the fraudsters
    install malware that take the form of software updates on the computers of their
    targets.
  id: totrans-11

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 往往，利用交换条件策略的攻击者扮演作为IT服务的人的欺诈者的角色。攻击者通常会尽可能多地拨打来自组织的直线电话，并为他们的目标提供IT援助。然后，他们将承诺快速解决某个IT问题，同时促使他们的目标关闭其防病毒程序。一旦目标同意，欺诈者就会在他们的目标计算机上安装恶意软件，这些软件会伪装成软件更新。
- en: There are also cases wherein attackers use less sophisticated ploys of quid
    pro quo.  For instance, attackers know that many people, specifically office workers,
    would be willing to share their passwords in exchange for a bar of chocolate or
    even a cheap pen.
  id: totrans-12

  zh: 也有些情况下，攻击者使用较不复杂的交换条件策略。例如，攻击者知道许多人，特别是办公室工作人员，愿意交换密码以换取一块巧克力，甚至是一支廉价的笔。
- en: Another form of social engineering is baiting, which is similar to phishing
    and quid pro quo in many ways.  Attackers who use baiting employ online schemes
    that entice their targets to surrender their login credentials to a suspicious
    website in exchange for a good or an item.  More often than not, attackers offer
    their targets with free movie or music downloads.

  zh: 另一种社会工程学的形式是诱饵攻击，它在许多方面类似于网络钓鱼和交换条件。攻击者利用诱饵来诱使目标向可疑网站提供其登录凭据，以换取一种商品或物品。往往，攻击者向目标提供免费的电影或音乐下载。
- en: However, baiting is not limited to online schemes.  Attackers who use this type
    of social engineering can also exploit the human curiosity through physical media. 
    There was a case in which a founder of an organization along with his team infected
    and dispersed a number of USBs with a Trojan virus around the parking lot of his
    organization.  Most of the employees picked up and plugged the USBs into their
    gadgets such as computers, laptops, and tablets out of curiosity.  Once they plugged
    the USBs, a keylogger was activated and the founder was able to access the login
    credentials of his employees.

  zh: 但是，诱饵攻击并不局限于在线计划。利用这种社会工程学的攻击者还可以通过物理媒体利用人类的好奇心。曾经有这样一个案例，一个组织的创始人和他的团队在组织停车场周围散布了许多带有特洛伊木马病毒的U盘。大多数员工出于好奇，拾起并将U盘插入其电脑、笔记本电脑和平板电脑中。一旦插入了U盘，键盘记录器就会被激活，创始人就能够访问员工的登录凭据。
- en: Tailgating, also known as “piggybacking,” is a social engineering form that
    involves attackers who have no proper authentication in an organization.  The
    attackers follow employees to obtain access in a restricted area.

  zh: 尾随，也称为“搭便车”，是一种社会工程学形式，涉及在组织中没有适当认证的攻击者。攻击者跟踪员工以获取进入受限区域的权限。
- en: A tailgating attack often involves attackers who pose as delivery drivers waiting
    at an organization's parking lot.  When the attackers see an employee gaining
    the security's approval, the attackers who usually carry “goods for delivery”
    ask the employee to hold the door.  Thus, they gain access from someone who is
    authorized to get into the building.

  zh: 闯关攻击通常涉及伪装成等待在组织停车场的送货司机的攻击者。当攻击者看到员工得到了安全审批时，通常携带“交货物品”的攻击者会要求员工扶着门。这样，他们就从一个被授权进入建筑物的人那里获得了进入权限。
- en: Social engineers often use tailgating in small organizations or companies given
    that most large companies require employees to swipe their identification cards. 
    However, in the case of small to mid-sized companies, attackers can easily converse
    with employees to show the security a sense of familiarity, getting past the latter
    as well as the front desk.

  zh: 社会工程师通常在小型组织或公司中使用闯关攻击，因为大多数大公司要求员工刷他们的身份证。然而，在中小型公司的情况下，攻击者可以轻易地与员工交谈，向安全人员展示一种熟悉感，从而绕过后者以及前台。
- en: A known security consultant used tailgating to access into several floors of
    a building, including one that housed the data room of a financial firm.  The
    consultant was able to access the building's third floor meeting room wherein
    he worked for a few days in order to obtain information.

  zh: 一位知名的安全顾问曾利用闯关攻击进入了一栋大楼的几层，其中包括一家金融公司的数据室。该顾问能够进入建筑物的三楼会议室，在那里工作了几天以获取信息。
- en: Clearly, social engineering attacks are far-flung and considered as an enormous
    threat to various organizations.  Social engineering can cost targets thousands,
    if not, millions of dollars annually as it attacks people with access or knowledge
    to an organization's sensitive information.  Today, most attackers leverage various
    tactics and social networking schemes in order to obtain professional and personal
    information of their targets.  The people who are most susceptible to social engineering
    attackers are the new employees, followed by contractors, human resources, executive
    assistants, IT personnel, and business leaders.

  zh: 显然，社会工程攻击遍布各个组织，并被视为对各种组织的巨大威胁。社会工程可能会使目标每年损失数千甚至数百万美元，因为它攻击了拥有组织敏感信息访问权限或知识的人员。今天，大多数攻击者利用各种策略和社交网络方案来获取他们目标的专业和个人信息。最容易受到社会工程攻击的人员是新员工，其次是承包商、人力资源、高级助理、IT人员和业务领导。
- en: Unfortunately, some organizations do not have an awareness and prevention program
    to counter social engineering.  In addition, there are organizations who do not
    have security policies or employee training that prevent tactics of social engineering.

  zh: 不幸的是，一些组织没有意识和预防计划来对抗社会工程。此外，也有一些组织没有防范社会工程策略的安全政策或员工培训。
- en: This book offers valuable information about social engineering.  In the first
    chapter, you will learn what social engineering is and what social engineers want
    as well as the different ploys that attackers use.  The second chapter of this
    book offers pertinent information on the basic psychological tactics that attackers
    use to implement their social engineering schemes.
