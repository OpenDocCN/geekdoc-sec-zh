- en: The lecture as a teaching tool is dead. Current programs don't work because
    we rely on old models of teaching. People learn in different ways. Some people
    are visual learners, while others learn better from reading or discussing. We
    need to move away from canned web-delivered training to interactive, hands-on
    learning to build more effective security awareness programs.

- en: No one likes a lecture, except maybe the person giving it. For the lecturer,
    the act of giving a lecture is an active exercise. For those attending, the lecture
    is a passive exercise. Passive learning is shown to be not as effective as active
    learning when conveying information. In fact, many in higher education say that
    the lecture, a centuries-old teaching technique, is dead [[1](#bb0010)].

- en: 'Research shows that we should do something that universities have been moving
    toward in the past few years: replacing passive learning with active learning.
    Active learning depending on how it is implemented has become known at “peer instruction”
    or “interactive learning.” These techniques make the student responsible for their
    own learning as well as fostering interaction with other students in interacting
    with the material to be learned [[2](#bb0015)].'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Peer instruction” and “interactive learning” take the form of giving students
    assignments to read or videos to watch and then splitting the students into groups
    to interact with the material. These interactions involve writing assignments,
    group discussion, completing assigned tasks as a team, and sometimes a group grade
    [[3](#bb0020)]. Sometimes, students play question and answer games based on popular
    game show formats to engage the material. Points can be awarded in candy or toward
    a group grade [[4](#bb0025)].

    breaches that involved exploiting a human in order to gain access to data on an
    almost daily basis. Users are also showing signs of message malaise. Most users
    think they will never be tricked into clicking on a link or opening an attachment,
    because they view themselves as savvy Internet users.

- en: Bruce Schneier, chief security technology officer at BT, wrote an opinion piece
    for the website [Darkreading.com](http://Darkreading.com) in March 2013 saying
    that money spent on user awareness training would be better spent on better system
    design [[5](#bb0030)]. The post caused a firestorm in information security circles.
    Some people agree with him but most do not [[6](#bb0035),[7](#bb0040)]. Everybody
    agrees we have to do something, even Schneier says, “Security is a process, not
    a product” [[8](#bb0045)]. If we never inform end users of threats, they will
    never know about them.

    awareness campaigns use memorable spokesmen like Smokey the Bear and McGruff the
    Crime Dog. They also have memorable slogans like “Only you can prevent forest
    fires,” and “Take a bite out of crime.” In the field of information security awareness,
    we fail at these two simple goals because we continue to have debates about the
    effectiveness of security awareness programs.

    The process of security is a long hard road that begins with getting management
    buy-in, drafting and enforcing policies that give the user expectations of what
    they can and cannot do with the organizations technological resources, building
    an effective security awareness program, and then measuring the effectiveness
    of that program using meaningful metrics.
  prefs: []

    of policies, awareness program, and metrics, and changes are made based on the
    organization's needs.

    is to give people the tools to do something rather than nothing. While there is
    value in making sure your organization has the latest security products and that
    your IT staff has proper security training, it is a waste of time and money if
    you ignore the human factor. Next-generation firewalls, antivirus, intrusion detection
    systems, intrusion prevention systems, and web application firewalls are all great
    productions, but these products do not provide protection against an employee
    making a poor decision about clicking links, opening attachments, and other nontechnical
    attacks employed by social engineers.

    differently than those entering the workforce thirty years ago. Some people learn

    By involving more of the brain during learning, we remember more of what we learn.

    areas of the brain responsible for each learning style.

    best for your organization. Studies have shown that hands-on learning is retained
    more than other kinds of learning [[10](#bb0055),[11](#bb0060)]. Hands-on learning
    is active learning. Traditional security awareness programs are composed of slide
    shows, lectures, and videos. If the slide shows, lectures, and videos are given
    in person rather than delivered via a website, it is a step toward more active
    learning since it gives opportunities for the trainer and the participants to
    interact.

- en: “Active learning” is defined as “… an approach to classroom instruction in which
    students engage material through talking, writing, reading, reflecting, or questioning—in
    other words, through being active.” Active learning puts aside the old practices
    of simply lecturing employees on security best practices. The approach takes security
    awareness program to the next level through exercises involving talking, reading,
    writing, reflecting, and questioning [[12](#bb0065)].

    if they can explain the best practices for passwords and discuss what makes a
    good password. Another example is for trainees to discuss the types of malware
    they have encountered in the past, how they think it got on their computers, and
    what they think the attacker was after. This will help to illustrate to users
    that malware isn't just an inconvenience that slows down their computer, but is
    an attempt by online criminals to steal data off of their computers, to use their
    computer as part of a botnet, to use their computer to hide child porn and other
    contraband, or to use their computer to gain a beachhead to further their attack
    on the organization's network and steal more data. Both of these examples involve
    discussion but both could make a good writing and discussion exercise if you ask
    them to write down their answers and then discuss them. Another exercise would
    be to have the trainees to read one or more of the organization's security policies
    and then to reflect on why the policy is in place and to question why the organization
    needs such a policy.

    an employee starts or an hour during the yearly security awareness day. Active
    learning exercises will require an organization to implement a continuous learning
    paradigm ([Figure 6.1](#f0010)). One personal example of this is the reminder
    cards I left on people's desks when they did not lock their computer screens.

- en: While users found the reminder intrusive, over time, we had people become more
    compliant with the policy. Security awareness programs will become more effective
    if organizations place more time, money, and value in them. Once a year is not
    enough. A quick look at the news of continuing breaches because of social engineering
    attacks or a quick look at [http://www.ponemon.org/](http://www.ponemon.org/)
    at the ongoing costs of data breaches should be enough to illustrate that while
    security awareness programs are getting better, we are not doing enough. Organizations
    spend millions of dollars a year on security products to protect their network
    edge. Organizations also need to start giving time and money to security awareness
    programs to protect themselves, their business partners, and their customers from
    social engineering attacks.

- en: Building a security awareness program is a process. The most important thing
    one can do is to begin that process with the end in mind. No organization will
    be totally secure and no security awareness program will completely protect you
    from breaches. Breaches will still happen, but with the right amount of effort,
    you can make your organization more secure and hopefully less likely to suffer
    a breach from social engineering.
