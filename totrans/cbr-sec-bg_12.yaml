    a new drug formula that showed a lot of promise.  When the company tried to patent
    the formula, the patent office discovered the drug was already being produced
    and sold in China.  Investigators learned that a trusted employee in China had
    stolen a copy of the formula and sold it for just a few thousand dollars.  Despite
    this fact, the drug could no longer be patented.  The thief went to prison for
    a very long time, but the pharmaceutical company lost potential revenues in the
    hundreds of millions of dollars.
