- en: Scott Pinzon, my friend and this book’s technical editor, has always liked (and
    related to) that song, “The Girl from Ipanema.” But the dude watching her in that
    song is clearly an amateur people-watcher. If he had read this chapter, he probably
    would have figured out what hotel she’s staying at (hotel key card), her probable
    income (are those flip-flops from Wal-Mart or Dolce-Gabbana?), and maybe even
    her room number (after shoulder-surfing the waiter to catch a glimpse of the room
    number on her bill). Skilled people watchers can learn a whole lot more in just
    a few quick glances. In this chapter we’ll take a look at a few examples of the
    types of things that draws a no-tech hacker’s eye.

- en: People watching is a real skill. There’s so much to it, that I can’t possibly
    cover all the angles in one short chapter. But it’s an important topic, because
    a decent no-tech hacker can get a good read on a person by just paying attention.
    In this chapter, we’ll take a look at a few simple examples of effective people
    watching.

    the baseball cap. What can you tell me about him?

- en: Let’s start with the boots. Although I’m not well-versed enough to know an Adidas
    GSG9 from a High Tech Magnum Stealth, I can say without a doubt that those are
    tactical boots. The jeans are pretty non-descript, except for the fact that his
    wallet’s sticking out of them (no, I’m not tempted to snag it to get a better
    profile on the guy), and his black T-shirt tells me that he’s a tough-guy type
    (or a severe wanna-be). His gaze is locked on a female flight attendant, which
    seconds the tough-guy image and lets us in on his sexual preference. His haircut
    is short, although it’s too soon to tell if he’d describe it as “high and tight”—a
    military term for hair that’s cut high … and tight. His glasses are Oakleys, and
    I’ve heard people call them *shooters,* because they’re often found at gun ranges,
    worn by people who shoot. You know, guns. Topping all this off is the baseball
    hat. There’s a logo on the back that’s hard to read, but here’s a close-up.

    makes serious camouflaged armor-piercing shotguns with, like, built-in missile
    launchers and flamethrowers. OK, so they don’t make missile launchers and flamethrowers,
    but they make serious weapons for hunters and Marines and cops. Take a guess which
    of the three this guy is. Think you’ve got it nailed? I’d say this guy is either
    law enforcement or military—most likely Special Forces of some kind. Now, let’s
    say, hypothetically, that he pre-boarded the plane, in front of a little old lady
    in a wheelchair? Would that change your perception of this guy? It would change
    mine.

    Arms: muscular and tan (below the elbows). Accessories: one wedding band and an
    Iron Man watch. The first impression is simple—married, and military.'

    Military Casualty Statistics,” and his inbox shows emails from Lieutenant Colonels
    (LTC) and Majors (MAJ). I don’t really care what this guy’s up to because I’m
    not one of the bad guys. However, if I were a bad guy, I’d have access to a lot
    of information about this guy in a very short period of time.

- en: Using the rotating lens on my camera, I stood with my back to this guy and took
    the shot backwards. In the process, I caught a bit of my shirt in the shot, which
    blurred the edges of the photo. But taking a look at our target, we see pressed
    slacks, black socks and wing tips. His shirt is decidedly business casual, although
    it’s a strange kind of pinkish orange. He’s wearing a nice watch and he’s sporting
    a big class ring. The magazine is some sort of financial/news rag.

    story. Moving in closer, I stood next to him and took a photo of his bag, shown
    in the next picture.

- en: The guy didn’t seem to notice that I stood right next to him and took pictures
    of his stuff. The bag sported the logo of a very specific U.S. Government agency
    which had recently been highlighted in the international news scene. Because of
    the agency’s very specific mission and recent public interest, I knew somewhere
    in the world someone would be very interested to know where this guy was headed
    and where he was from. I walked back to my original position some distance ahead
    of him, and lined up my next backwards shot.

    photo and gave me this look. I really wish I could show you the look on his face,
    but I won’t jeopardize his privacy. Just believe me when I say he gave me this
    dead serious *why are you taking my picture, you stalking terrorist scumbag* kind
    of look. Had I known he was looking right at my camera when I took the photo,
    I definitely wouldn’t have hung around long enough to get this next photo that
    captures his name and frequent flier number.

- en: The thing that surprises me the most about this example is that I know this
    guy saw me take his picture. There’s a good chance he saw me take quite a few
    pictures, and he may have even watched me as I moved around him getting (what
    I thought were) relatively discrete photos of him and his gear. Knowing that he
    worked for an *interesting* government agency, I’m not sure why he didn’t do something
    about me. I don’t have any ill intent, but there’s no way he could have know that.
    For all he knew, I could have been some kind of creepy stalker taking photos of
    him at the airport, or worse. I could have been sponsored by a foreign government,
    who tasked me with the job of tracking his agency’s activities. There’s really
    no telling who I was, but this guy chose to do what most people do—absolutely
    nothing. Therein lies the problem. At some point creepy stalker people should
    be reported to *someone.* I can only hope that the worst thing that happens to
    this guy is he gets his blurred, unrecognizable photo published in this humble
    book.

    colors is a bad idea. These examples focused on individuals in the Government
    and Military. I’m not trying to make any kind of statement, it’s just that I didn’t
    happen to include any corporate examples despite having examples from the entire
    corporate spectrum: banking, finance, manufacturing, investing, healthcare, retail
    and more. Depending on current events, political climate or other factors, anyone
    can become a target of public scrutiny or unwanted attention. Government agencies
    have requested for years that employees travel low profile, but those same agencies
    still produce signature items sporting the agency logo. The best advice I can
    offer you is to play it smart. Take a moment to consider your profile, and every
    now and then play it paranoid. A no-tech hacker might be the least of your worries.'
