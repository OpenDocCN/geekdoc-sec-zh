    find is in the Bible, in the book of Genesis, and it reportedly happened around
    1800 BCE. Jacob wanted the blessing that was to be given to his older brother
    Esau. Knowing his father, Isaac, had failing eyesight and relied on other senses
    to know who he was speaking to, Jacob dressed in Esau''s clothing and prepared
    food like Esau would have prepared. Here''s the best part: Esau was known to be
    extraordinarily hairy, but Jacob wasn''t, so he fastened the skins of two young
    goats to his arms and the back of his neck. When Isaac reached out to touch Jacob,
    Isaac relied on his senses of smell, touch, and taste to tell him that he was
    with Esau rather than Jacob. According to the account in Genesis, Jacob''s social

    only as a social engineer, but as a professional who is offering social engineering
    services to your customers. The fact is that, with the exception of reporting,
    these steps are followed by the malicious social engineers in the world.

    their OSINT phase, they found out that their targets used a popular site called
    CareerBuilder.

    This led them to plan a pretext as a job seeker, who was looking to get hired
    at whatever role their targets were offering. They realized the tools they needed
    would be some maliciously encoded files and some realistic-looking resumes.

    from a trusted and reputable source (CareerBuilder). Consequently, the target
    would open the attachment without thinking. And that is exactly the goal of the
    malicious social engineer: to get the target to take an action that is *not* in
    their best interest without thinking through the potential dangers involved.  ##

- en: When I started to plan this book, I wanted to make sure that I kept to the outline
    of the first edition of *Social Engineering* so those who benefited from its pages
    would benefit from this book too. At the same time, I wanted to change the book
    and update it to cover some of new attacks and things I never discussed in the
    previous book.

    I See?,” discusses OSINT and covers some of the timeless techniques used. I refrain
    from delving into actual tools too much, although I mention a few that have stayed
    in my tool chest for the last decade.

    engineering. I cover tips, tricks, and many of the experiences (both successes
    and failures) that I have had over the years.'

    from the many podcasts, newsletters, and conversations with some of the world's
    greats—like Robin Dreeke—and apply the principles of rapport-building to social
    engineering. Robin Dreeke is the head of the FBI's Behavioral Analysis Unit and
    a good friend of mine. He is a master at building rapport and trust and has defined
    the steps to do both.

    and shows how they can and are being used by social engineers.'

    social engineering attacks.

- en: No book that I write would be complete without a cooking analogy, so here it
    goes. Like any great meal, there is a lot of planning, a great recipe that calls
    for fresh ingredients, and then artistic and scientific execution. Social engineering,
    although simplistic in nature, is not a recipe for a novice. It involves understanding
    how humans make decisions, what motivates them, and how to control your own emotions
    while exploiting those same processes in others.

    even more so now. In the past eight years, I have watched many people rise as
    professional social engineers. I have seen many malicious social engineers rise
    and fall too.

    imperative that all security professionals understand social engineering. But
    there is so much more to this topic. I remember when I started working as a chef
    (in a former life a long time ago), my mentor would take ingredients and tell
    me to taste little bits of each. But why?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He told me that I couldn't possibly know what it means “to taste” if I didn't
    really understand what each item tasted like. If I know that the recipe calls
    for some horseradish, and I want it to be a little spicier, then I understand
    that I could add a little bit more. Understanding that a certain ingredient also
    has a salty quality might make me adjust my salt for the recipe, so items are
    not overly seasoned. You get the point.
  prefs: []

- en: Even if you are not in the security industry, it is important to understand
    how each of these ingredients “tastes” so you can be protected. What does it mean
    to build rapport with someone, and how can that be used to get you to part with
    your money? (This is covered in [Chapter 5](c05.xhtml).) How does influence, when
    sprinkled in an elicitation conversation, make someone give up a password over
    the phone? (This is covered in [Chapters 6](c06.xhtml) and [7](c07.xhtml).)

    you can recognize when someone tries them out on you, and you are more secure.
    You can sense something isn't right, and you can take defensive actions.

    a dish that he hates, he identifies the specific problem: “This dish has way too
    much pepper and they used too much oil.” A novice, on the other hand, might say,
    “It''s too spicy and greasy.” Are those two descriptions the same thing? I think
    not. My goal is to help you become a Gordon Ramsay of the SE world—but maybe with
