    Moral Molecule: How Trust Works* (Dutton, 2012). In this book, Dr. Zak wrote about

    the Pigeon Drop. When he was a young man, Zak worked in a gas station. One day,
    a patron came in to report that he'd found a box of jewels in the bathroom. As
    this “good citizen” was turning over the box to Zak so he could put it in the
    gas station's lost and found, the phone rang. On the phone was a frantic man looking

    from the gas station''s cash register and give it to the man who''d found the
    jewels. When the reward came in, Dr. Zak could keep $100 for himself and replace
    the $100 he took from the till. The scam-artist caller made Zak feel like he was
    part of a tribe by trusting him with two things: a share in the money prize for
    finding the “jewelry” and the responsibility of making someone else happy. He
    was scammed by this dynamic duo.'

    to associate a positive feeling with the caller. So, when the caller requested
    that Zak give the man who found the jewels $100 out of the cash register, he happily
    complied.

    Involved in Face-to-Face Interactions: A Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging
    Approach to Empathy” that was conducted by researchers Martin Schulte-Ruther,
    Hans J. Markowitsch, Gereon R. Fink, and Martina Piefk (`[www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17651008](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17651008)`).
    It discusses the effect that an empathy-based request for assistance has on a
    fellow human. The study makes the point that just viewing someone who''s making
    an emotional request can trigger areas of the brain related to first-hand emotional
    pain experience.'

    connection can make it next to impossible for the person to refuse to help.

    music that invoke certain emotions as requests are being made. Amazingly, this
    seems to work even if you are not face-to-face with the target. Although the connection
    is more powerful when facial expressions are involved, they're not necessary to
    trigger the needed emotional connection. The voice or a vivid description that
    causes the target to picture a scene can create an empathetic response.

    for this principle: The level of the assistance you request must be equal to the
    level of rapport you have built. If someone you''ve just met and your lifelong
    best friend both ask you to help them move furniture for the day, which request
    are you most likely going to honor first? You''re probably going to choose to
    assist your lifelong friend first because the level of rapport you have with a
    person helps you make the decision to devote time and effort to helping. If someone
    with whom you have no rapport requests assistance that''s too personal or too
    great, it has the reverse effect of building rapport and can make you suspicious.'

  prefs: []

    on the topic, I started to make direct requests to him for assistance. The more
    we spoke and the stronger our rapport, the more detailed and personal my requests
    became. Eventually, I was able to apply a very powerful derivative of this principle,
    referred to as “reverse social engineering.” In other words, I didn't have to
    apply any social engineering principles to gain compliance—the rapport I built
    with OilHater almost forced him into continually trsuting me and giving me more
    details.

    of a target. I was able to apply this principle during Operation Oil, and when
    OilHater finally trusted me enough to request my help, when his level of trust
    reached a point where he came to me to share his ideas—that is when our “relationship”
    was set in stone. By continually asking OilHater for more and more assistance
    in understanding the problem and potential threats and then coming to his aid
    when he needed help, I had developed a very strong rapport with him.  #### *Suspending
    Your Ego*'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This one principle of rapport is so powerful, if you can master it, you might
    be unstoppable. But it's not nearly as easy to do as you might think.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To understand why mastering this principle can be difficult, let me first define
    ego suspension. True ego suspension is literally letting go of your ego—your need
    to be first, to be correct, or to be perceived as smart—and your knowledge of
    what is right and wrong. When you suspend your ego, you set all that aside for
    the other person, and it's not something you can easily fake.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Why is this so powerful, yet so hard to do? Often, people feel weak if they
    must admit they don't know something. And how are weak people often portrayed?
    In media, movies, music, and other forms of entertainment, people who are humble
    or meek are often viewed as victims. In my opinion, these general perceptions
    make practicing suspension of ego a difficult principle to apply. No one wants
    to be perceived as weak.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Here''s an example to help you understand why it''s hard to fake this: You''re
    standing in a line at the grocery store, and you overhear a conversation in which
    someone says, “I heard from a very reliable source that if you want to cure yourself
    of all allergies, all you need to do is wash your face with a blend of milk, honey,
    and spring water three times a day.”'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    reaction when you read that statement? If you thought something like, “That is
    one of the dumbest things I have ever read,” or “These people need to be set straight,”
    then you weren't applying ego suspension. Suspending your ego would mean hearing
    someone's thoughts on a matter and reacting with, “This is their opinion, and
    they are entitled to have it, so let me try and understand their point of view.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Ego suspension requires you to consider someone else's thoughts, statements,
    and opinions as the right of that person—regardless of whether or not you agree
    with them. It also involves having the ability to disagree without being disagreeable.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In Operation Oil, I was able to apply the principle of ego suspension by acting
    like I had no knowledge about fracking and the oil industry (although I didn't
    have to pretend too much). Additionally, by not questioning the things OilHater
    said about how terrible, dangerous, and deadly the fracking industry is, I suspended
    my own ego and allowed OilHater to be the “boss.” Any time the social engineer
    can suspend his or her ego and allow the target to inflate theirs, it is a perfect
    mix for successful rapport building.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Another factor in the successful application of this principle is having some
    knowledge about the topic and the ability to ask good questions. A combination
    of limited knowledge and good questions helps the target continue to be dominant
    and allows the social engineer to display ego suspension. I used this aspect of
    the principle in Operation Oil by continually asking OilHater for more information
    and to help me get to a deeper understanding of the little bits of knowledge I
    had. This inflated his ego as I suspended my own.  #### *Validating Others*'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    is agreeing with, complimenting, or endorsing someone else's statements, decisions,
    or choices. When someone feels validated by you, their brain releases dopamine
    and oxytocin, which in turn enables you to create feelings of trust and rapport.

    I saw that she had about a dozen pictures of her kids, and they were facing out,
    not in. This indicated to me that she was proud of her family and wanted others
    to see them. The pictures were of various vacations they had taken, and everyone
    in the photos looked really happy.

    I realized her daughters were maybe 12 and 15\. I was mortified, and I could see
    she shared the sentiment.

    day to complete the test.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Besides hitting a 100% creep factor, I was also nowhere near the necessary level
    of rapport to allow me to compliment her children in that manner. A proper validation

    Where did you go?” Or even, “That's a beautiful picture. I never seem to capture
    those great moments of my kids.”

    That's because when you suspend your ego and allow the other person to expand
    his or her ego, it's validating for them. That feeling of validation can create
    rapport, and when a person feels validated, their brain releases those good chemicals
    again (dopamine and oxytocin)—and you are the reason for all this good stuff.

    you can read the paragraphs multiple times and assimilate the information before

    corresponding online. For example, my good friend Jim Manley gets mad at me when
    he sends me an eight-paragraph email detailing a problem or situation, and I read
    only one or two sentences and then reply with a question. He always replies with
    something like, “READ THE WHOLE EMAIL, HADNAGY!!” (Yes, I censored his responses
    drastically.) If you are like me, you need to practice active listening—even in

    is when the target later thinks to themself, “Man, that was a great conversation
    I had today with … Hmm, what was his name? Where was he from? Wait, I told him
    my full name and date of birth, showed him pictures of my kids, and even let him

    you have the choice to make them feel better or feel worse for having met you.
