    of a target. I was able to apply this principle during Operation Oil, and when
    OilHater finally trusted me enough to request my help, when his level of trust
    reached a point where he came to me to share his ideas—that is when our “relationship”

- en: Why is this so powerful, yet so hard to do? Often, people feel weak if they
    must admit they don't know something. And how are weak people often portrayed?
    In media, movies, music, and other forms of entertainment, people who are humble

- en: One of the questions about these skills that I often get asked is how to practice
    them without being a social engineer yet (i.e., when you're in training) so that
    they come naturally when you do begin to use them in professional SE. In this
    section, I give you some tips on how to practice and perfect the 10 principles.

  zh: 我经常被问到关于这些技能的问题是，在成为社会工程师之前（即在培训期间），如何练习它们，以便在你开始在专业的社会工程中使用它们时自然而然地运用。在本节中，我给出了一些关于如何练习和完善这10个原则的建议。

- en: You don't have to wait to be on the clock to practice. Pick one principle, such
    as validation, and try your hand at it the next time you're at a family gathering.
    Observe a cousin you haven't seen for a while and then try to offer a sincere
    compliment. Follow that up with a question about her or his life and actively
    listen to the response. See how willing she or he is to answer.

  zh: 你不必等待时机才开始练习。选择一个原则，比如验证，然后在下次家庭聚会时试试手。观察一位你有一段时间没见的堂兄弟姐妹，然后试着给出真诚的赞美。随后问问他们的生活情况，并积极倾听回答。看看他们愿意回答到什么程度。
- en: 'At the next gathering or work event, pick another principle, such as accommodating
    nonverbals, and notice the different ways people react to you depending on how
    much or little you face them. Over time, you begin to develop a toolkit of what
    works and what doesn''t, and you start putting the principles into practice even
    when you''re not actively thinking about them.  ### Read'

  zh: '在下次聚会或工作活动中，选择另一个原则，比如适应非言语交流，然后注意人们根据你面对他们的多少而作出的不同反应。随着时间的推移，你开始建立一个工具包，了解什么有效，什么无效，并且即使在不主动考虑它们的时候也开始实践这些原则。
    ### 阅读'
- en: 'There are a lot of books (like Robin Dreeke''s) that talk about rapport building.
    You can find a pretty comprehensive list on `[www.social-engineer.org/resources/seorg-book-list](http://www.social-engineer.org/resources/seorg-book-list)`.
    Reading about these principles reinforces them in your mind and makes it easier
    for you to call upon them when you need to.  ### Take Special Note of Failures'

    ### 特别注意失败'

    drain, don't try to hide and forget it. Instead, take special note of what happened
    and why.

- en: 'I''ve learned more from my failures than from my successes, and consequently,
    my successes mean more because of my failures. Learning from my failures and taking
    special note of them enables me to be a better teacher of these skills as well
    as a better social engineering professional.  ## Summary'

    ## 总结'
- en: This chapter walked you through how to recognize, use, and benefit from the
    ability to build rapport with anyone. These skills are powerful when you're communicating
    with other people and are essential for you to become a professional social engineer.

  zh: 本章介绍了如何识别、使用并从与任何人建立关系的能力中获益。当你与其他人交流时，这些技能是非常强大的，对你成为一名专业社会工程师至关重要。
- en: 'Regardless of whether you are phishing, vishing, SMiShing, or impersonating,
    you need these skills to get the maximum benefit. But I have one final note: It
    is just as important to learn how to disengage without ruining rapport as it is
    to learn to build the rapport.'

  zh: 无论你是进行钓鱼、虚假电话、SMiShing 还是冒充，你都需要这些技能以获得最大的好处。但我有一个最后的建议：学会如何在不破坏关系的情况下退出同样重要，就像学会建立关系一样重要。
- en: I've noticed that disengaging tends to be one of the most difficult skills for
    my students to manage after they get the principles to work, because disengaging
    feels bad. Your target is pouring out their life story to you and telling you
    everything you wanted to know (as well as some things you didn't want to know),
    and now you're just supposed to walk away?

  zh: 我注意到，脱身往往是我学生在掌握了这些原则后最难掌握的技能之一，因为脱身会让人感到不舒服。你的目标正在向你倾诉他们的生活故事，并告诉你所有你想知道的事情（以及一些你不想知道的事情），现在你只是应该走开吗？

    disengaging will be easy. Let me give you a couple examples.

- en: If you employ quid pro quo and validation to build rapport, you can say, “Well,
    look at that! You're so fascinating to talk to *[more validation]* that I forgot
    I'm supposed to pick up salad makings for my wife/husband on the way home. I'd
    better bolt *[confirming the quid pro quo by giving the target the “personal”
    information that you are having salad tonight and you have a spouse]*!”

- en: Rapport links you to your fellow humans. As you link to more and more people,
    you have the choice to make them feel better or feel worse for having met you.
    In each choice you make on how to use these skills you have the power to influence
    or manipulate the person you are talking to. That's the topic of [Chapter 6](c06.xhtml),
    “Under the Influence.”
