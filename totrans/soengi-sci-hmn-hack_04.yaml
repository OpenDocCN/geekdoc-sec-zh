    a very direct communicator. Because of this, I don't mind someone telling me when
    something I did wasn't the best—the key is that you need to tell me how to improve.
    I also tend to communicate that way with others, which can cause a lot of problems
    when I am communicating with a person who doesn't like directness.

    it's easier for some people than for others. The challenge occurs when we get

    our “comfort zone.”

    not stay in your comfort zone, though. The more you try something, the greater

    ways to measure the energy of behavior and consciousness. Although he did not
    develop the test that I discuss in this chapter, he developed this model and then
    applied it in some work he did with Universal Studios in 1930\. They wanted to

    only one photo of the guy. Let me paint the scene for you.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The photo shows a busy city street where there has been a car accident. It's
    not deadly—just a fender bender. The street is filled with people running toward
    the cars to see if everyone is okay. The target is standing with his back to the
    accident, not looking—his shoulders slumped down, and his hands in his pocket.
    That is all.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Based on the description of the scene, where would you put him on DISC diagram?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Think about those questions I asked you. Based on what I've told you about the
    photo, is the man more task-oriented or people-oriented? You really can't say
    “people-oriented,” can you? So, the answer would seem to be “task-oriented.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Is he direct or indirect? While everyone else is focusing on the accident, he
    shows a lack of directness in that area. Robin guessed indirect.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That would put the target in the bottom-left segment, or in *C*, on the chart
    in [Figure 3-6](#c03-fig-0006)—which makes him analytical, reserved, precise,
    private, and systematic. He was heading somewhere, and that task took precedence
    over anything else. His body language did not scream outgoing or forceful, which
    lands him most accurately in the *C* region.

    you know whether I'm direct or indirect? You can still effectively communicate
    with me as a direct person, even if I'm also in the Conscientious or Supporter
    category.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    and see where his comments seem to fall. I read them and think *task*, for sure.
    Now is his style direct or indirect? Hmm … this one seems a bit harder.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Take a look at the media he posted. I see very direct messages about *things,*
    not people. This confirms for me that Nick is more of a *D*.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Even if you cannot pinpoint someone 100%, you can get close. In the case of
    Nick, you can see he is definitely task-focused rather than people-focused. So
    guessing that he's a *D* or *C* would be okay.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another secret of the trade is to look at some of the descriptors the person
    uses. Jump back to [Figure 3-6](#c03-fig-0006) and look at the descriptor words
    next to both *D* and *C*. Which words describe what you see in Nick's tweets?
    Is he more direct, forceful, and results-oriented? Or is he precise, private,
    and systematic?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When I read these tweets, I certainly see more of a *D* than a *C*. Does this
    mean Nick is 100% a *D* communicator? Not exactly—sometimes people communicate
    a certain way depending on where, how, and with whom they're communicating. For
    instance, when I train, I tend to communicate more as an *I* than a *D*. It is
    better for me, the students and everyone else involved. If you wanted to influence
    me, you need to figure out how I communicate in the medium you are trying to influence
    me in.

    communication. From there, the rest seems easy.

    their communication happy zone doesn't mean you will always have 100% success.
    Sickness, stress, workload, and many other factors can affect someone's ability
    to communicate effectively. Need proof that there are limitations? Think about
    your kids (or the kids of people you know).

    to myself, “Is this for real or another joke from Dave? Why would anyone say these
    things to me about *my* book?” I gave him a small smile, thanked him, and handed
    back his signed book. He was noticeably disappointed, but people were waiting
    in line behind him, so I moved on. About four or five other people came through

    your target trust you and want to help you. Learn to read people quickly, and
    then learn how to apply your profile and adjust your style so you can communicate
    with your targets more easily.
