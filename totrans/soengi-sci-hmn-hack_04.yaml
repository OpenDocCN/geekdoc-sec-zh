    mean Nick is 100% a *D* communicator? Not exactly—sometimes people communicate
    a certain way depending on where, how, and with whom they're communicating. For
    instance, when I train, I tend to communicate more as an *I* than a *D*. It is
    better for me, the students and everyone else involved. If you wanted to influence
