    targets. This chapter helps you to steer customers away from the Mission Impossible
    mentality and toward more practical objectives. Practical Social Engineering is
    less about dropping down nuclear cooling towers on ropes while avoiding lasers,
    and more about delivering value by identifying risks, even where time constraints
    tie one hand behind your back.

    to guide a client down the right path when it comes to services rendered. While
    the client may know that they need a service, they may not fully understand the
    subtleties of the profession to the extent required. It is for this reason that
    you will often see unrealistic requests in terms of target selection. As a social
    engineer, it is a big part of your job to ensure that realistic and relevant objectives
    are set and achieved through the use of threat modeling. Threat modeling is very
    much a consultative process that the engineer and client must explore if a project

    People would be forgiven for thinking that an individual working in a modern organization
    would always be able to identify their key assets and build suitable defenses
    around them. Penetration testing and social engineering engagements down the years
    have taught me that this is rarely the case, sometimes to quite an eye-opening
    extent.
  id: totrans-35

  zh: 乍看之下，这似乎是一个多余的章节。人们会原谅认为在现代组织中工作的个人总是能够识别他们的关键资产并围绕它们建立合适的防御。多年来的渗透测试和社会工程学案例告诉我，情况很少是这样的，有时甚至相当令人大开眼界。
- en: A recent example was during a recent internal assessment where the client had
    moved into a new facility and as a result everything was brand new. All the servers
    were running the very latest operating system and were fully patched. The same
    could be said of the desktop estate. What the client didn’t know was that an employee
    had plugged a rogue access point into the corporate network and configured it
    with WEP no less. The point being made here is that if a business thinks that
    they know about everything that is going on in the organization and infrastructures,
    the chances are they don’t. The client in question had spent a lot of time and
    effort securing what they believed were the only entry points to their most critical
    assets. They had installed Firewalls and Intrusion Prevention System (IPS), used
    up-to-date software and best practices, but what they didn’t do is shut down any
    unused switch ports and enable port security or monitor for rogue access points.
    Although this may not be directly related to Social Engineering, it’s nigh on
    impossible to know all the entry points to an asset if the focus is purely on
    technology. A Firewall will never stop an authorized member of staff from leaking
    critical information over the phone, neither will the former “Nuclear Bunker”
    that the Data Center is housed in. As a result, the reasons for needing threat
    modeling are clear. It’s very difficult to even identify the critical assets without
    taking a step back and looking at the bigger picture. Therefore, let’s talk through
    a common example of a client requirement, and why it isn’t always particularly
    realistic.

  zh: 最近的一个例子是在最近的内部评估中，客户搬进了一个新设施，结果一切都是全新的。所有服务器都在运行最新的操作系统，并且已经完全打了补丁。桌面设备也是如此。客户不知道的是，一名员工插入了一个流氓接入点到企业网络，并且配置了WEP。这里要说的是，如果一个企业认为他们了解组织和基础设施中正在发生的一切，那么他们的机会是不大的。受评估客户花了很多时间和精力来保护他们认为是他们最关键资产的唯一入口点。他们安装了防火墙和入侵防护系统（IPS），使用了最新的软件和最佳实践，但他们没有关闭任何未使用的交换机端口，并启用端口安全或监视流氓接入点。虽然这可能与社会工程学直接相关，但如果重点仅仅是技术，几乎不可能知道资产的所有入口点。防火墙永远不会阻止授权员工通过电话泄漏关键信息，数据中心所在的前“核掩体”也不会。因此，需要威胁建模的原因是明确的。即使不希望受到社会工程的影响，也很难在不从更大的角度审视的情况下识别出关键资产。因此，让我们讨论一个常见的客户需求示例，以及为什么这并不总是特别现实。

- en: The asset needs to be defined to the client to enable them to move away from
    this thinking. The information is an asset, not just the physical server. The
    focus here is in protecting against the exfiltration of sensitive data, so let’s
    explore the attack vectors for that. While not wanting to get bogged down in talk
    of asset and risk classification just now, it does need to be briefly touched
    upon. The client needs to define what is important to them as a business, to find
    out who and what has access to it, and assess the risk and vulnerabilities associated
    to the asset(s). It could be intellectual property, client data, or even credit

    social engineer would attempt to gain access to it. For example, the data may
    be intellectual property in the form of plans for a new product, which are stored
    in a database. The client may feel that an attacker would have to gain physical
    access to the network to recover the data but he may choose to manipulate somebody
    within the organization that has access to the asset. The information may be stored

  zh: 为什么？
- en: Why is the asset important? Why is it important that this information is protected
    against leakage? The impact may be purely financial due to fines levied by regulatory
    bodies. On the other hand, the data being leaked could be classified in nature
    and cause compromises in combat scenarios. Loss of reputation is also a common
    issue wherever a compromise occurs. Whatever the reason for the asset’s significance,
    it is worthwhile thinking about classifying each of them and assigning a value
    to them that allows you to prioritize the work. The client may feel that a user
    who leaks passwords is the biggest fear, but if client data is leaked, it could
    bring with it a hefty fine in line with the Data Protection Act 1998, as well
    as a significant reputational damage. Just look at Sony’s £250,000 fine as an
    example. It’s not that passwords aren’t important, it’s just that we need to apply
    levels of importance to our assets. Everything in a business is there for a reason,
    but we can’t assign a criticality rating of 10 out of 10 to everything.

    point of view as well as from a logical one. When logical location is mentioned,
    this is its location on the network, which in most cases will be a designated
    VLAN or separate switch infrastructure. The physical location could be *in a filing

- en: In the case of a recently compromised Associated Press Twitter account, the
    SEA were able to send the stock market into panic and drop the value of the Dow
    Jones by $136 billion. They achieved this by claiming that explosions within the
    White House had killed the President. Not only did they use social engineering
    to gain access to the accounts, but they then used impersonation to achieve their
    objective too. It’s interesting just how often basic impersonation is used in
    social engineering engagements. A phone call posing as another individual or an
    e-mail from a domain that looks a lot like the target’s can often provide just
    enough leverage.

    techniques. The vast majority implement broad-scale phishing attacks. This is
    very likely down to the simplicity, low maintenance, and large target audience
    of such scams. A very recent case (June 19, 2013) was uncovered by the Met Police
    Central e-Crime Unit, the Serious Organised Crime Agency, and the US Secret Service.
    The general idea behind the phishing scam was to gain access to the bank accounts
    of its victims. The group hosted in excess of 2500 fake web sites that were clones
    of legitimate banking sites. It was estimated that £59m of fraud was prevented
    in the United Kingdom alone. Possibly the most interesting aspect of this entire
    scam was its scale. The attacks were successful against people from across the
    globe, not just from the United States and United Kingdom as you may be forgiven
    for thinking.

    outliers. Just because a social engineer or hacker is not state sponsored does
    not mean that this should be taken any less seriously. On the contrary, it is
    often the hobbyist, trouble causer, or prankster that causes us the biggest problems.

- en: One of the most famous cases of recent times was that of the Australian Radio
    pranksters from 2Day FM. The prank was simple, call the hospital that the Duchess
    of Cambridge was admitted to, pretend to be Queen Elizabeth II, and see where
    it leads. The truth of the matter is that the DJs were not expecting to be put
    through to anybody, let alone be given actual information. Where the call led
    couldn’t have been predicted by anybody. First of all, the level of information
    given could be deemed interesting to say the least. This included information
    such as visiting times, as well as the movements of Prince William as well as
    the general condition of the Duchess. In an industry where patient confidentiality
    is so highly guarded, it is surprising that this sort of thing is allowed to happen.
    Sadly, this is not where the story ends. Following on from the media uproar, the
    nurse that disclosed the information committed suicide. She had left a note blaming
    the Radio DJs for her death. While this is an extreme and saddening case, there
    are things that we can learn as social engineers. First of all, how much formal
    training the nurses had been given regarding the handling of phone calls? It is
    hoped that they had not only been trained, but made aware of social engineering
    on the whole. If it wasn’t Radio pranksters making the call, it would have been
    Journalists trying to get a scoop.

    act is given and the right questions asked, it is very likely that answers will
    be obtained. Even in extreme and sometimes silly circumstances. This is a case
    of building a pretext and using it to gain unauthorized access.

- en: A final point is one of an ethical nature. It is very difficult for a social
    engineer to keep themselves in check and still be able to live the pretext. It
    can be easy to be swept away into doing something you may regret. Don’t forget
    that the person on the other end of that phone does not want to be a victim of
    your deception. This is where not naming names comes into the picture again. We
    are not in this business to single out individuals and embarrass or shame them.
    As with the Nurse in this story, the consequences can be truly horrible. Always
    bare this in mind when engaging with a client. Emphasize the point of company-wide
    education, not individual naming and punishment.

    things in perspective. It is almost certain that the hospital in question will
    have introduced all kinds of formal training to try and address the shortcomings
    they fell victim to. The damage to their reputation was obviously tangible. There
    are usually financial implications for the unauthorized leakage of patient records
    too. Sadly, there was far more than reputation and money at stake in this instance.

    people or businesses without your consent. It is most likely that these people
    are employed to do this for “an honest living.” Salespeople are a classic example
    of social engineers. A Salesperson will not hesitate to be creative with the truth
    to win business. Largely, these will be in the form of smaller mistruths that
    allow them to get on the phone with their target. These can often be as simple
    as “*Can you pass me through to Andrew Mason, he is expecting my call?”* or *“Hi,
    I was just speaking with Gavin Watson and was cut off, could you pass me back
    through please? It is an urgent matter*.” The impact of allowing sales calls through
    to staff could probably be deemed a nuisance at best, but the lack of process
    that allows this to happen is worthy of serious review.

    your rivals utilizing the same flaws? Competitive intelligence may be deemed legal,
    but industrial and economic espionage are not. This has not halted their existence
    however. Telekom Malaysia Bhd had to investigate an alleged case of industrial
    espionage recently. They had received complaints that an employee of one of its
    partners had gained access to a rival’s facility by posing as a member of Telekom
    Malaysia’s entourage. Tailgating is one thing, but being recognized as a member
    of a larger, authorized group? Defending against these kinds of issues can be
    difficult at the best of times. Diligence when dealing with large groups of visitors
    is the key here, do not bypass any policies on visitors just because it’s too
    difficult to deal with large volumes of them. Shortcutting the usual procedures
    will always lead to problems.

    modeling. Why an attacker may think differently, and how they may take an entirely
    unexpected route to the critical data. This was to hit home upon the *Get into
    my Data Center* point. This is often not the easiest way to exfiltrate data. Why
    go in the front door, when a side door grants us the same level of access with
    far fewer complications?
