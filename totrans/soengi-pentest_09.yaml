    targets. This chapter helps you to steer customers away from the Mission Impossible
    mentality and toward more practical objectives. Practical Social Engineering is
    less about dropping down nuclear cooling towers on ropes while avoiding lasers,
    and more about delivering value by identifying risks, even where time constraints
    tie one hand behind your back.

    to guide a client down the right path when it comes to services rendered. While
    the client may know that they need a service, they may not fully understand the
    subtleties of the profession to the extent required. It is for this reason that
    you will often see unrealistic requests in terms of target selection. As a social
    engineer, it is a big part of your job to ensure that realistic and relevant objectives
    are set and achieved through the use of threat modeling. Threat modeling is very
    much a consultative process that the engineer and client must explore if a project
    is going to be successful.

    People would be forgiven for thinking that an individual working in a modern organization
    would always be able to identify their key assets and build suitable defenses
    around them. Penetration testing and social engineering engagements down the years
    have taught me that this is rarely the case, sometimes to quite an eye-opening
    extent.

- en: A recent example was during a recent internal assessment where the client had
    moved into a new facility and as a result everything was brand new. All the servers
    were running the very latest operating system and were fully patched. The same
    could be said of the desktop estate. What the client didn’t know was that an employee
    had plugged a rogue access point into the corporate network and configured it
    with WEP no less. The point being made here is that if a business thinks that
    they know about everything that is going on in the organization and infrastructures,
    the chances are they don’t. The client in question had spent a lot of time and
    effort securing what they believed were the only entry points to their most critical
    assets. They had installed Firewalls and Intrusion Prevention System (IPS), used
    up-to-date software and best practices, but what they didn’t do is shut down any
    unused switch ports and enable port security or monitor for rogue access points.
    Although this may not be directly related to Social Engineering, it’s nigh on
    impossible to know all the entry points to an asset if the focus is purely on
    technology. A Firewall will never stop an authorized member of staff from leaking
    critical information over the phone, neither will the former “Nuclear Bunker”
    that the Data Center is housed in. As a result, the reasons for needing threat
    modeling are clear. It’s very difficult to even identify the critical assets without
    taking a step back and looking at the bigger picture. Therefore, let’s talk through
    a common example of a client requirement, and why it isn’t always particularly
    realistic.

    think *Crown Jewels* and then their chain of thought leads them to where those
    assets are physically stored. This is kind of funny given the highly connected
    nature of the assets we are dealing with, and the entirely nonphysical nature
    of them to boot.
  prefs: []

- en: The asset needs to be defined to the client to enable them to move away from
    this thinking. The information is an asset, not just the physical server. The
    focus here is in protecting against the exfiltration of sensitive data, so let’s
    explore the attack vectors for that. While not wanting to get bogged down in talk
    of asset and risk classification just now, it does need to be briefly touched
    upon. The client needs to define what is important to them as a business, to find
    out who and what has access to it, and assess the risk and vulnerabilities associated
    to the asset(s). It could be intellectual property, client data, or even credit
    card details.

    actually be common sense.
  prefs: []

    pieces of information so that an accurate assessment of the attack vectors can
    take place. A suitable approach can be to follow a “what, why, who, where, and
    how” approach when it comes to establishing where the risks lie. This approach
    is no doubt less formal than going down the IA route, but it is still a very valuable
    tool, both for you and your client.

    What regulatory guidelines does it fall under? It is likely that the vast majority
    of clients know what their key data is, but maybe they won’t know how a malicious
    social engineer would attempt to gain access to it. For example, the data may
    be intellectual property in the form of plans for a new product, which are stored
    in a database. The client may feel that an attacker would have to gain physical
    access to the network to recover the data but he may choose to manipulate somebody
    within the organization that has access to the asset. The information may be stored
    in hard copy in a filing cabinet elsewhere within the business, and if so, is
    it sufficiently secured?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    largely going to be looking through network diagrams and asset lists for the vast
    majority of cases. There will be instances in which plans and confidential data
    will be kept on hard record, and this needs to be accounted for throughout this
    process. Part of this process may be for your client to know where all of the
    information is stored, including physical copies. This task on its own could take
    even a small business a very long time and should not be underestimated.

    against leakage? The impact may be purely financial due to fines levied by regulatory
    bodies. On the other hand, the data being leaked could be classified in nature
    and cause compromises in combat scenarios. Loss of reputation is also a common
    issue wherever a compromise occurs. Whatever the reason for the asset’s significance,
    it is worthwhile thinking about classifying each of them and assigning a value
    to them that allows you to prioritize the work. The client may feel that a user
    who leaks passwords is the biggest fear, but if client data is leaked, it could
    bring with it a hefty fine in line with the Data Protection Act 1998, as well
    as a significant reputational damage. Just look at Sony’s £250,000 fine as an
    example. It’s not that passwords aren’t important, it’s just that we need to apply
    levels of importance to our assets. Everything in a business is there for a reason,
    but we can’t assign a criticality rating of 10 out of 10 to everything.

    from stakeholders throughout the business will be required to adequately conduct

    the process of identifying it and its importance, but who can get to the asset?
    Who uses it? Why do they use it? How often and when do they use it? All of this

    point of view as well as from a logical one. When logical location is mentioned,
    this is its location on the network, which in most cases will be a designated
    VLAN or separate switch infrastructure. The physical location could be *in a filing
    cabinet* or *in cab 421, Data Center 2*, the point is how can the risk to an asset

    best angle available. Targeted or even broader e-mail phishing attacks could really
    bring back some frightening results assuming each member of staff has Internet

    For example, the “Syrian Electronic Army” (SEA) appears to be quite prolific at
    the moment, hacking or gaining access to the *BBC Weather* site and Twitter accounts
    for various agencies, including *Reuters, The Onion*, and *Financial Times*. At
    the time of writing, it is too soon to fully understand how the @thomsonreuters

    to gain access to the accounts, but they then used impersonation to achieve their
    objective too. It’s interesting just how often basic impersonation is used in
    social engineering engagements. A phone call posing as another individual or an
    e-mail from a domain that looks a lot like the target’s can often provide just
    enough leverage.

    techniques. The vast majority implement broad-scale phishing attacks. This is
    very likely down to the simplicity, low maintenance, and large target audience
    of such scams. A very recent case (June 19, 2013) was uncovered by the Met Police
    Central e-Crime Unit, the Serious Organised Crime Agency, and the US Secret Service.
    The general idea behind the phishing scam was to gain access to the bank accounts
    of its victims. The group hosted in excess of 2500 fake web sites that were clones
    of legitimate banking sites. It was estimated that £59m of fraud was prevented
    in the United Kingdom alone. Possibly the most interesting aspect of this entire
    scam was its scale. The attacks were successful against people from across the
    globe, not just from the United States and United Kingdom as you may be forgiven

    outliers. Just because a social engineer or hacker is not state sponsored does

    often the hobbyist, trouble causer, or prankster that causes us the biggest problems.

    pranksters from 2Day FM. The prank was simple, call the hospital that the Duchess
    of Cambridge was admitted to, pretend to be Queen Elizabeth II, and see where
    it leads. The truth of the matter is that the DJs were not expecting to be put
    through to anybody, let alone be given actual information. Where the call led
    couldn’t have been predicted by anybody. First of all, the level of information
    given could be deemed interesting to say the least. This included information
    such as visiting times, as well as the movements of Prince William as well as
    the general condition of the Duchess. In an industry where patient confidentiality
    is so highly guarded, it is surprising that this sort of thing is allowed to happen.
    Sadly, this is not where the story ends. Following on from the media uproar, the
    nurse that disclosed the information committed suicide. She had left a note blaming
    the Radio DJs for her death. While this is an extreme and saddening case, there
    are things that we can learn as social engineers. First of all, how much formal
    training the nurses had been given regarding the handling of phone calls? It is
    hoped that they had not only been trained, but made aware of social engineering
    on the whole. If it wasn’t Radio pranksters making the call, it would have been
    Journalists trying to get a scoop.

    engineer to keep themselves in check and still be able to live the pretext. It
    can be easy to be swept away into doing something you may regret. Don’t forget
    that the person on the other end of that phone does not want to be a victim of
    your deception. This is where not naming names comes into the picture again. We
    are not in this business to single out individuals and embarrass or shame them.
    As with the Nurse in this story, the consequences can be truly horrible. Always
    bare this in mind when engaging with a client. Emphasize the point of company-wide
    education, not individual naming and punishment.

    are usually financial implications for the unauthorized leakage of patient records
    too. Sadly, there was far more than reputation and money at stake in this instance.

    are employed to do this for “an honest living.” Salespeople are a classic example
    of social engineers. A Salesperson will not hesitate to be creative with the truth
    to win business. Largely, these will be in the form of smaller mistruths that
    allow them to get on the phone with their target. These can often be as simple
    as “*Can you pass me through to Andrew Mason, he is expecting my call?”* or *“Hi,
    I was just speaking with Gavin Watson and was cut off, could you pass me back
    through please? It is an urgent matter*.” The impact of allowing sales calls through

    partners had gained access to a rival’s facility by posing as a member of Telekom
    Malaysia’s entourage. Tailgating is one thing, but being recognized as a member
    of a larger, authorized group? Defending against these kinds of issues can be
    difficult at the best of times. Diligence when dealing with large groups of visitors
    is the key here, do not bypass any policies on visitors just because it’s too
    difficult to deal with large volumes of them. Shortcutting the usual procedures
