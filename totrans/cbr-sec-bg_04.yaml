- en: A heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) sub-contractor had permission
    to remotely access the Target network for the purpose of remotely monitoring their
    in-store HVAC systems.

- en: A copy of the supplier’s permission credentials was stolen. Analysts believe
    the thieves used a botnet (a type of malware) to scrape (steal) these identity
    and password credentials.

    gain access to a part of the network (network segment) that contained access to
    Point of Sale payment systems.

- en: After the breach, darkreading.com revealed that Microsoft had published a case
    study, available on the Internet, about the Target IT infrastructure, including
    naming the Microsoft device management software that the company was using.  No
    one knows whether or not the hackers referenced this study to help plan the attack.  
    However, investigators believe that this device management software was used to
    distribute another type of malware on certain Point of Sale devices that processed
    card payments.

    details back out of the Target network using files that were also disguised.

- en: A recently installed FireEye malware detection system in which Target had invested
    did raise security alerts and notified Target headquarters in late November. 
    For some reason, no immediate action was taken at that time.  This is known in
    security circles as a failure to trigger an adequate incident response.

    stolen data from external drop-off points.

    to be present or to be adequate.  Listing those controls is something I can do,
    but for our purposes we should focus on the primary root causes.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Everybody expected and relied upon somebody else’s controls to work if their
    own failed.  This is a drawback of poorly implemented ‘defense in depth’; you
    may think that your own security layer or ‘piece’ is not vital enough to be a
    point of significant failure.  When an alarm was raised, no effective response
    process was triggered.
  prefs:

- en: The security, risk and budget culture was asset and silo focused; nobody adequately
    considered the big (enterprise) picture of how all those ‘little’ risks might
    be stacked together to create a problem of this scale.  (See the chapter on ‘stacked
    risks’ later in the book.)
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The security controls and processes that were present were generally set to
    meet the current minimum security needs and standards.  Such standards are generally
    not updated in a timely manner in response to evolving threats.  They generally
    only protect against issues that have been a concern for a few years. For example,
    the fact that Target had passed some assessments against the Payment Card Industry
    Data Security Standards (PCI DSS) did not mean that the security posture was sufficient.
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    number of potential vulnerabilities.

    alert reports from the anti-malware team had been responded to correctly, that
    could have prevented the breach.

- en: There were about 50 different security controls that could have been in place
    to either stop or substantially reduce the duration and scale of this breach. 
    Some of those security control options were not present, and those that were (for
    example, incident response), failed to operate sufficiently.

- en: It is important to note that each major cyber breach does not occur momentarily. 
    Usually, the breaches that happen today take place over a period of time.  This
    is evidenced by the fact that most breaches are not reported as taking place on
    a specific date, at a specific time; instead, they are reported to have occurred
    in a particular month or across a number of months or even years.  Target, Home
    Depot, NSA (Edward Snowden), Sony, Mossack Fonseca, Myspace, Yahoo – you name
    the breach and look at the duration, and you will consistently find the event
    involved a span of time.

- en: If the breach happens to be an organization’s first, major cyber breach, the
    senior management team may misguidedly fail to report the event and to quickly
    engage the right countermeasures.  This is a terrible mistake that leads to even
    greater damage.  This fourth mistake did not happen at Target.  As soon as Target’s
    senior executives were informed, the incident was managed correctly.
