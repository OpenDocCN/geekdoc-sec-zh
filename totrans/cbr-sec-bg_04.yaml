- en: After the breach, darkreading.com revealed that Microsoft had published a case
    study, available on the Internet, about the Target IT infrastructure, including
    naming the Microsoft device management software that the company was using.  No
    one knows whether or not the hackers referenced this study to help plan the attack.  
    However, investigators believe that this device management software was used to
    distribute another type of malware on certain Point of Sale devices that processed
    card payments.

    did raise security alerts and notified Target headquarters in late November. 
    For some reason, no immediate action was taken at that time.  This is known in
    security circles as a failure to trigger an adequate incident response.

    but for our purposes we should focus on the primary root causes.
  id: totrans-22
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Everybody expected and relied upon somebody else’s controls to work if their
    own failed.  This is a drawback of poorly implemented ‘defense in depth’; you
    may think that your own security layer or ‘piece’ is not vital enough to be a
    point of significant failure.  When an alarm was raised, no effective response
    process was triggered.

  zh: 每个人都期望并依赖于别人的控制措施在自己的措施失败时起作用。这是‘深度防御’实施不当的一个缺点；您可能认为自己的安全层或‘部分’不足以成为重大故障点。当警报被触发时，没有触发有效的响应流程。
- en: The security, risk and budget culture was asset and silo focused; nobody adequately
    considered the big (enterprise) picture of how all those ‘little’ risks might
    be stacked together to create a problem of this scale.  (See the chapter on ‘stacked
    risks’ later in the book.)

- en: The security controls and processes that were present were generally set to
    meet the current minimum security needs and standards.  Such standards are generally
    not updated in a timely manner in response to evolving threats.  They generally
    only protect against issues that have been a concern for a few years. For example,
    the fact that Target had passed some assessments against the Payment Card Industry
    Data Security Standards (PCI DSS) did not mean that the security posture was sufficient.

  zh: 存在的安全控制和流程通常被设置为满足当前的最低安全需求和标准。这些标准通常没有及时更新以应对不断发展的威胁。它们通常只能防范几年来一直存在的问题。例如，Target通过了一些针对支付卡行业数据安全标准（PCI
    DSS）的评估并不意味着安全姿态足够。

    number of potential vulnerabilities.

    alert reports from the anti-malware team had been responded to correctly, that
    could have prevented the breach.

- en: There were about 50 different security controls that could have been in place
    to either stop or substantially reduce the duration and scale of this breach. 
    Some of those security control options were not present, and those that were (for
    example, incident response), failed to operate sufficiently.

  zh: 可能有大约50种不同的安全控制措施可以阻止或大幅减少这次入侵的持续时间和规模。其中一些安全控制选项不存在，而那些存在的（例如，事件响应）未能充分运作。
- en: It is important to note that each major cyber breach does not occur momentarily. 
    Usually, the breaches that happen today take place over a period of time.  This
    is evidenced by the fact that most breaches are not reported as taking place on
    a specific date, at a specific time; instead, they are reported to have occurred
    in a particular month or across a number of months or even years.  Target, Home
    Depot, NSA (Edward Snowden), Sony, Mossack Fonseca, Myspace, Yahoo – you name
    the breach and look at the duration, and you will consistently find the event
    involved a span of time.

  zh: 值得注意的是，每次重大网络入侵并非瞬间发生。通常，今天发生的入侵是在一段时间内发生的。这一点可以从大多数入侵并非发生在特定日期、特定时间这一事实得到证明；相反，它们被报告为发生在某个特定月份或跨越数个月甚至数年。Target、Home
    Depot、NSA（爱德华·斯诺登）、索尼、莫萨克·方塞卡、Myspace、雅虎 - 你可以列举出入侵事件并查看持续时间，你会发现这些事件都涉及一段时间。

  zh: 通常也会有第四类情况（但并非总是如此）：
- en: If the breach happens to be an organization’s first, major cyber breach, the
    senior management team may misguidedly fail to report the event and to quickly
    engage the right countermeasures.  This is a terrible mistake that leads to even
    greater damage.  This fourth mistake did not happen at Target.  As soon as Target’s
    senior executives were informed, the incident was managed correctly.

  zh: 如果遭遇的入侵是组织的首次重大网络入侵，高级管理团队可能会错误地选择不报告事件并且不迅速采取正确的对策。这是一个严重的错误，会导致更大的损失。这种第四个错误在
    Target 公司并没有发生。一旦 Target 公司的高级管理人员被告知，事件就得到了正确处理。
