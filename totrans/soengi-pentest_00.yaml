- en: I can still remember clearly when I sat down and started writing the framework
    at [social-engineer.org](http://www.social-engineer.org). I searched the Internet
    for helpful hints on topics I wanted to cover. Nevertheless, Social Engineering
    was not a hot topic at that time.

    but nothing to do with security. Around the same time I was writing the framework,
    I worked hard to try and include social engineering in any security work I was
    doing. Most of the time companies would say things like, “Why try? We know we
    will fail.” or “There is no way anything like that would work on me!”

    social engineering was. Fast forward now years into the future, people are emailing
    and calling for quotes on social engineering work every day. With the increase
    in interest comes the increase in “providers” of these services.

- en: Unfortunately, for you, the readers of this book, there are so many providers
    it must be mind numbing to try and chose the right one. You may have asked yourself
    questions like “How do I know I am working with a good provider of SE Services?”
    “What is a social engineering pentest really?” and many more questions.

    strict about slapping a foreword inside these pages, until I read the book and
    understood what message these guys were trying to send. I had a few phone meetings
    to discuss their thoughts on topics and then I received the early editions of
    their writing.

- en: As I read through each chapter, I felt like I found a group of guys who “got
    it.” They made it clear what a social engineering pentest is, what questions you
    should ask, and how you can make the best of the budget you have to include this
    very important aspect into your yearly checkups.

    be one of the few, now one of the many but a book like this will help you find
    those of us that really know, understand, and ARE social engineering professionals.

    especially enjoy [Chapter 5](CHP005.xhtml). It will help you understand then relate
    why it is important to engage a social engineer for your security needs.

    coverage of a very difficult topic that I know any ardent student of social engineering
    will want to study.

    you are seeking information on how to set up an effective awareness program.'

- en: I truly appreciate the chance I have had to read the work of Gavin, Andrew,
    and Richard. They have been open to my advice, more than patient with my busy
    schedule but most importantly they care about security. They don’t preach “stupid
    users” but they preach “uneducated users,” that is a message I hold close to my
    heart. My motto from day 1 has been “Security through education.” It is nice to
    find a group, like the authors of this book, that think the same way.
