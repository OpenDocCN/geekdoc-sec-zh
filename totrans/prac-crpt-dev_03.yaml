    developers should know, like cryptographic **hash functions** (SHA-256, SHA3,
    RIPEMD and others), **HMAC** (hashed message authentication code), password to
    **key derivation** functions (like **Scrypt**), the Diffie-Hellman key-exchange
    protocol, **symmetric key** encryption schemes (like the **AES** cipher with CBC
    and CTR block modes) and **asymmetric key** encryption schemes with public and
    private keys (like the **RSA** cipher and elliptic curves-based cryptography /
    **ECC**, the secp256k1 curve and the Ed25519 cryptosystem), **digital signatures**
    and **ECDSA**, as well as the concept of **entropy** and secure **random number**
    generation and **quantum-safe cryptography**.

    of information. It is used everywhere in our digital world: when you open a Web
    site, send an email or connect to the WiFi network. That''s why developers should
    have **at least basic understanding of cryptography** and how to use crypto algorithms
    and crypto libraries, to understand hashing, symmetric and asymmetric ciphers
    and encryption schemes, as well as digital signatures and the cryptosystems and
    algorithms behind them.'

- en: Cryptography deals with **storing and transmitting data in a secure way**, such
    that only those, for whom it is intended, can read and process it. This may involve
    **encrypting and decrypting data** using symmetric or asymmetric encryption schemes,
    where one or more **keys** are used to transform data from plain to encrypted
    form and back.

- en: '**Symmetric encryption** (like AES, Twofish and ChaCha20) uses the same key
    to encrypt and decrypt messages, while **asymmetric encryption** uses a **public-key
    cryptosystem** (like RSA or ECC) and a key-pair: public key (encryption key) and
    corresponding private key (decryption key). Encryption algorithms are often combined
    in encryption schemes (like AES-256-CTR-HMAC-SHA-256, ChaCha20-Poly1305 or ECIES-secp256k1-AES-128-GCM).'

    these **keys are derived** from numbers, passwords or passphrases using **key

    message authenticity, integrity and non-repudiation. Most digital signature algorithms
    (like DSA, ECDSA and EdDSA) use **asymmetric key pair** (private and public key):
    the message is **signed** by the private key and the signature is **verified**
    by the corresponding public key. In the bank systems **digital signatures** are
    used to sign and approve payments. In blockchain signed transactions allow users
    to transfer a blockchain asset from one address to another.'

    message authentication codes (MAC codes) to prove message authenticity, integrity
    and authorship. Authentication is used side by side with encryption, to ensure

    randomness) and secure generation of random numbers (e.g. using CSPRNG). **Secure
    random numbers** are unpredictable by nature and developers should care about
    them, because broken random generator means compromised or hacked system or app.

    and ECDH) and **key establishment schemes**, used to securely establish encryption
    **keys** between two parties that intend to transmit messages securely using **encryption**.
    Such algorithms are performed typically when a new secure connection between two
    parties is established, e.g. when you open a modern Web site or connect to the
    WiFi network.

    which transform messages to **message digest** (hash of fixed length), which cannot
    be reversed back to the original message and almost uniquely identifies the input.
    In **blockchain** systems, for example, hashes are used to generate blockchain
    addresses, transaction ID and in many other algorithms and protocols. In **Git**
    cryptographic hashes are used for generating unique ID for files and commits.

    and Argon2) protect user passwords and password encrypted documents and data by
    securely deriving a hash (or key) from a text-based passwords, injecting random
    parameters (salt) and using a lot of iterations and computing resources to make
    password cracking slow.'

- en: In cryptography the hashing, encryption algorithms and random generators follow
    the Shannon's principles of [confusion and diffusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confusion_and_diffusion).
    **Confusion** means that each bit in the output form a cipher should depend on
    several parts of the key and input data and thus direct mapping cannot be established.
    **Diffusion** means that changing one bit in the input should change approximately
    half of the bits in the output. These principles are incorporated in most hash
    functions, MAC algorithms, random number generators, symmetric and asymmetric
    ciphers.

    language and platform and how to use them. Developing with cryptography requires
    **understanding of the crypto-concepts**. Copy / pasting code from Internet or
    following an example from a blog may lead to insecure design and weak security.
    Cryptographic libraries are very useful, but you should **understand the concepts**
    first, then choose appropriate combination of algorithms and adjust carefully
    their parameters.
