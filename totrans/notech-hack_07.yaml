    actor, and con artist. Security experts roll up all of that and more in the term
    *social engineer.* A hacker experiments with a piece of technology to see if he
    can get useful results from it that its creator never intended. A social engineer
    does the same thing with human relationships.

    a visit from a stranger I had never seen in our building before. He came to my
    desk, said hello and introduced himself as a corporate external auditor who was
    auditing a group in our building. I knew and worked with a number of our own internal
    auditors, but this was the first real live external auditor that I had ever met.
    The first few seconds while we were shaking hands, I had that feeling from grade
    school: “Crap, the Principal has come to visit me; what have I done wrong?” I
    don’t care to experience that intimidated feeling often. But he quickly made me
    feel at ease by telling me that he wanted to meet whoever came up with these posters.
    They were so simple and yet so effective that he wanted to take the idea back
    to his company. I said thanks, and help yourself. (External auditors get whatever
    that want don’t they?) It really drilled home a lesson. You can put up a huge
    variety of posters, but to an auditor, they all say the same thing: due diligence.'

    I was faced with an ever-growing problem. More and more groups wanted to see the
    presentation, and I couldn’t possibly get to all of them. After all, giving these
    seminars wasn’t even a part of what my immediate group was supposed to do. My
    next step was to recommend that a video be prepared and used by all of the groups
    that I couldn’t get to. The initial reaction was that it would be too expensive.
    A studio-quality video can cost over $1,000 per finished minute to create. At
    those prices, even a 30-minute video would be out of the operating budget for
    most groups.

    video camera, I created it less than two hours for just about zero cost. Just
    to see how it would look, we ran the camera during an entire 30-minute session
    that I presented to a small group. We then created a video of nothing but the
    slides that were used. The remaining hour was spent editing the two videos together.
    Our intent was to try this a few times until we got it right. We were trying to
    come up with something that would be cheap (the most important part at the time)
    and effective. We had no idea how successful our first attempt would become. Over
    100 copies of it were sent all over the company, and most copies were shown a
    number of times throughout the next year to ensure that everyone had a chance
    to see it. As far as I know, it is still being shown.

    an awareness video. The Windows-based *Camtasia* product suite from Techsmith
    ([www.techsmith.com](http://www.techsmith.com)) is a great place to start. It
    can record whatever you are doing on your computer screen and render it as a video
    – basically, a video screen capture. With voice-over, that’s a perfect way to
    show the do’s and don’ts on your network. Mac users may consider Snapz Pro X from
    Ambrosia Software ([www.ambrosiasw.com](http://www.ambrosiasw.com)), also an excellent
    choice. Both tools allow you to capture on-screen video, presentations and real-time
    audio. If you’re fortunate enough to have a MacBook or MackBook Pro laptop, you
    can use the built-in video camera to record video footage as well, and iMovie
    to master your video presentation. Presto! Video without the need for a video
    camera!

    commercial. The equipment to create them is getting more sophisticated and less
    expensive all the time. If you try this yourself, I think that you will be pleasantly
    surprised at the outcome.
