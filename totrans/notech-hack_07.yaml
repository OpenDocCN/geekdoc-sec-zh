    actor, and con artist. Security experts roll up all of that and more in the term
    *social engineer.* A hacker experiments with a piece of technology to see if he
    can get useful results from it that its creator never intended. A social engineer
    does the same thing with human relationships.

    The black hats were using social engineering skills to gain access to proprietary

    you are an elite black hat hacker, and an international conglomerate has offered

    you see no challenge whatsoever in learning user names for Acronym’s network.
    Most big corporations assign user names systematically, derived from employee

    variations: joedoaks, jdoaks, JDoaks@Acronym, or some equivalent. If you can learn
    employee names, you can figure out user names. One obvious way to do this is to
    snag a printed corporate phone book (more on this later). But since you’re a smart
    and competent high-tech attacker, instead, you search Acronym’s Web site and find
    some names. You have many to choose from: executives, a PR person, a tech support

- en: If there is one thing I was taught at a young age it was to never be afraid
    to ask questions. If you don’t know the answer, ask. This didn’t really work during
    my fourth grade math tests, but everywhere else rendered great results. Asking
    questions shows intelligence. Not asking because you think you know it all is
    a sign of fool-headedness. Even if you know the answer, asking questions provides
    a way to tactfully measure others’ knowledge of the topic you may be discussing.
    People like to assume things as well. I can assume that because you’re calling
    me and asking me a question that you must have some knowledge about the subject,
    or else why would you be calling me?

    really help when you’re having a conversation on the phone. By asking questions
    back to any suspicious caller, you will drive away most of them. Ask for a phone
    number where the caller can be called back. That doesn’t guarantee anything, but
    I’ve often had potential social engineers hang up after that question. They don’t
    have an untraceable number ready.

    will not be answered about the company over the phone. This is an area where employees
    can get involved. At a monthly meeting, you can stage a “Social Engineering Attack
    Drill.” I’ve never been fond of role-playing sessions, but this is one area where
    role-playing is both fun and effective. The incoming caller can be engaged in
    industrial espionage, competitive spying, intentional destruction, just plain
    curiosity or any number of things. If the team “defending” the company prepares
    for the questions that might be asked over the phone, there is a good chance that
    they will hit on most of the questions that real social engineers ask. When they
    answer the phone in the role-playing scenarios, they benefit from rehearsing the
    act of considering carefully before answering questions.

    soon as a call came in that was even the slightest bit strange. Your telephonic
    awareness will improve, too. Of course phone attendants shouldn’t be insulting
    or rude to callers, but it’s entirely possible to be firm and alert without sounding
    impolite. If a caller is legitimate, they may even come to appreciate your willingness
    to protect company information. Don’t you feel safer about making credit card
    purchases at a store where the cashier politely asks to see your picture ID?

    I thought it would be a good idea to get the word out through the use of posters,
    but I wanted to make posters that were effective, eye catching and cheap. My self-imposed
    criteria also demanded that they be easily reproducible on a standard copy machine.
    With those thoughts in mind, I sat down with a clip art book and a slightly wild
    imagination. After about two hours, I had enough clip art drawings, and appropriate
    clever sayings, to design enough posters for the next two years. I sent out a
    new poster every three months to a select group of people. It didn’t take long
    for others to call and want to be added to my list for receiving the next poster.
    Some people started to collect them and line them up along their walls.

    a visit from a stranger I had never seen in our building before. He came to my

    auditing a group in our building. I knew and worked with a number of our own internal
    auditors, but this was the first real live external auditor that I had ever met.
    The first few seconds while we were shaking hands, I had that feeling from grade
    school: “Crap, the Principal has come to visit me; what have I done wrong?” I
    don’t care to experience that intimidated feeling often. But he quickly made me
    feel at ease by telling me that he wanted to meet whoever came up with these posters.
    They were so simple and yet so effective that he wanted to take the idea back
    to his company. I said thanks, and help yourself. (External auditors get whatever
    that want don’t they?) It really drilled home a lesson. You can put up a huge

    I was faced with an ever-growing problem. More and more groups wanted to see the
    presentation, and I couldn’t possibly get to all of them. After all, giving these
    seminars wasn’t even a part of what my immediate group was supposed to do. My
    next step was to recommend that a video be prepared and used by all of the groups
    that I couldn’t get to. The initial reaction was that it would be too expensive.
    A studio-quality video can cost over $1,000 per finished minute to create. At
    those prices, even a 30-minute video would be out of the operating budget for
    most groups.
  prefs: []

    video camera, I created it less than two hours for just about zero cost. Just
    to see how it would look, we ran the camera during an entire 30-minute session
    that I presented to a small group. We then created a video of nothing but the
    slides that were used. The remaining hour was spent editing the two videos together.
    Our intent was to try this a few times until we got it right. We were trying to
    come up with something that would be cheap (the most important part at the time)
    and effective. We had no idea how successful our first attempt would become. Over
    100 copies of it were sent all over the company, and most copies were shown a
    number of times throughout the next year to ensure that everyone had a chance
    to see it. As far as I know, it is still being shown.

    can record whatever you are doing on your computer screen and render it as a video
    – basically, a video screen capture. With voice-over, that’s a perfect way to
    show the do’s and don’ts on your network. Mac users may consider Snapz Pro X from
    Ambrosia Software ([www.ambrosiasw.com](http://www.ambrosiasw.com)), also an excellent
    choice. Both tools allow you to capture on-screen video, presentations and real-time
    audio. If you’re fortunate enough to have a MacBook or MackBook Pro laptop, you
    can use the built-in video camera to record video footage as well, and iMovie
    to master your video presentation. Presto! Video without the need for a video
    camera!
