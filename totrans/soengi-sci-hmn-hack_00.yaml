    that invention would take the world. I wanted to do something that was unheard
    of: create a personal computer. One that any person could use, enjoy, and benefit
    from. Jump forward only a short 40 or so years and that vision is a reality.'

    and technology being embedded into every aspect of our lives, it is important
    to take a step back and look at how we maintain safety and security while still
    innovating and growing and working with the next generation.

    I love seeing the ideas flow from them as they figure out new and creative ways
    to use technology. And I truly love being able to see how this technology can
    enhance people's lives.

    In 2004 when I gave the keynote speech at HOPE Conference, I said that a lot of
    hacking is playing with other people and getting them to do strange things. My
    friend, Kevin Mitnick, has mastered this over the years in one area of security
    called social engineering.

    it for all of us to understand. He has rewritten the book on it again, defining
    the core principles of how we as humans make decisions and how those very same
    processes can be manipulated.

    long as humans have. This book can prepare you, protect you, and educate you how
    to recognize, defend, and mitigate the risks that come from social engineering.
