    users have grown in popularity. These include the offer to fill out a survey for
    an online banking site with a monetary reward if the user includes account information,
    and email messages claiming to be from hotel reward clubs, asking users to verify
    credit card information that a customer may store on the legitimate site for reservation
    purposes. Included in the message is a uniform resource locater (URL) for the
    victim to use, which then directs the user to a site to enter their personal information.
    This site is crafted to closely mimic the look and feel of the legitimate site.
    The information is then collected and used by criminal enterprises. Over time,
    these fake emails and websites have evolved to become more technically deceiving
    to casual investigation.

    in the past, they were just vandals and delinquents. In 1999, the Melissa computer
    virus, which was widely considered a denial of service attack that was akin to
    juvenile vandalism in its intent. In 2000, The Love Bug virus, however, was much
    more sinister in its intent and was socially engineered to get people to click
    on an attachment to the email. Like Melissa, it targeted Microsoft Outlook users.
    But unlike Melissa, it spread to a victim’s entire address book instead of just
    the first 50 names. It deleted picture and sound files from the hard drive and
    apparently attempted to steal the computer’s password. Perhaps of greatest concern
    is the fact that experts were united in saying that the virus was such a simple
    program that even a sixth grader with Visual Basic scripting knowledge could have
    created it in a few hours. Indeed, the alleged perpetrators were students at a
    computer school without much training who simply copied source codes from previous
    viruses, purportedly with the intention of stealing computer passwords. The Love
    Bug underscored the need to recognize and effectively combat the risks that can
    potentially create severe business disruption, economic calamity, and national
    security breaches.

    Outlook用户。但与Melissa不同的是，它传播到受害者的整个通讯录，而不仅仅是前50个名字。它还从硬盘中删除图片和声音文件，并显然试图窃取计算机的密码。最令人担忧的或许是专家们一致认为这个病毒是如此简单的程序，以至于即使一个掌握Visual
    Basic脚本知识的六年级学生也可以在几个小时内创建它。事实上，据称犯罪嫌疑人是一所没有太多培训的计算机学校的学生，他们只是简单地从以前的病毒中复制源代码，据称是为了窃取计算机密码。爱情虫强调了识别和有效打击潜在造成严重业务中断、经济灾难和国家安全漏洞的风险的必要性。

    was very similar to Melissa, in that the malicious code arrived via email, probably
    from someone you knew, with an attachment called LOVE-LETTER-FOR-YOU.TXT.VBS.
    The suffix VBS meant that the attachment was executable code, not just text. Once
    the reader clicked on this file, I LOVE YOU attacked Microsoft Outlook and mailed
    a copy of itself to everyone on the victim’s mailing list, while Melissa just
    used the first 50 names. It infected the software that supports chat rooms so
    that anytime a chat room was set up, I LOVE YOU was sent out to all the chatters.
    It looked for picture, video, and music files to overwrite them with itself, since

    schemes that keep reoccurring over a long period of time. Organized criminal groups
    or criminal collectives that engage in targeted attacks motivated by profit-seeking
    are often involved in some type of fraudulent scheme. The pitch for these schemes,

    of social engineering. One approach to better understand social engineering is
    to understand the fraudulent schemes that are powered by social engineering. This

    someone in anticipation of receiving something of greater value, such as a loan,
    contract, investment, or gift and then receives little or nothing in return. The
    variety of advance fee schemes is limited only by the imagination of the con artists
    who offer them and they are all presented to the potential victim in as appealing
    a manner that a social engineer can craft. They may involve the sale of products
    or services, the offering of investments, lottery winnings, found money, or many
    other opportunities. For example, clever con artists will offer to find financing
    arrangements for their clients who pay a finder’s fee in advance. They require
    their clients to sign contracts in which the clients agree to pay the fee when
    they are introduced to the financing source. Victims often learn that they are
    ineligible for financing only after they have paid the finder according to the
    contract. Such agreements may be legal unless it can be shown that the finder
    never had the intention or the ability to provide financing for the victims.

    artificial buying pressure for a targeted security, generally a low-trading volume
    issuer in the ­over-the-counter securities market largely controlled by the fraud
    perpetrators. This artificially increased trading volume has the effect of artificially
    increasing the price of the targeted security (i.e., the pump), which is rapidly
    sold off into the inflated market for the security by the fraud perpetrators (i.e.,
    the dump). This results in illicit gains for the perpetrators and losses for innocent
    third-party investors. Typically, the increased trading volume is generated by
    inducing unwitting investors to purchase shares of the targeted security through
    false or deceptive sales practices and/or public information releases. A modern
    variation on this scheme involves largely foreign-based computer criminals gaining
    unauthorized access to the online brokerage accounts of unsuspecting victims in
    the United States. These victim accounts are then utilized to engage in coordinated
    online purchases of the targeted security to affect the pump portion of a manipulation,
    while the fraud perpetrators sell their pre-existing holdings in the targeted
    security into the inflated market to complete the dump.

- en: Affinity fraud almost always involves either a fake investment or an investment
    where the fraudster lies about important details (such as the risk of loss, the
    track record of the investment, or the background of the promoter of the scheme).
    Many affinity frauds are Ponzi or pyramid schemes, where money given to the promoter
    by new investors is paid to earlier investors to create the illusion that the
    so-called investment is successful. This tricks new investors into investing in
    the scheme, and lulls existing investors into believing their investments are
    safe. In reality, even if there really is an actual investment, the investment
    typically makes little or no profit. The fraudster simply takes new investors’
    money for their own personal use, often using some of it to pay off existing investors
    who may be growing suspicious. Eventually, when the supply of investor money dries
    up and current investors demand to be paid, the scheme collapses and investors
    discover that most or all of their money is gone.

    such as a particular denomination or church. It could be an ethnic group or an
    immigrant community. It could be a racial minority. It could be members of a particular
    workforce—even members of the military have been targets of these frauds. Fraudsters
    target any group they think they can convince to trust them with the group members’
    hard-earned savings. That is the key to this type of social engineering.

    may not realize the investment is actually a scam, and they may become unwitting

    Alert to warn investors about investment scams that purport to offer investors

    SEC staff are aware of a number of complaints and inquiries about these types
    of frauds, which may be promoted on social media and Internet sites, by telephone,
    email, in person, or by other means. In September 2010, a judgment order was entered
    in favor of the SEC based on allegations that a scam artist had misappropriated
    more than $3.7 million from 45 investors in four states by offering fake pre-IPO
    shares of companies, including AOL/Time Warner, Inc., Google, Inc., and Rosetta
    Stone, Inc., before the companies went public. Investors should be mindful of
    the risks involved with an offer to purchase pre-IPO shares in a company. Remember
    that the people and companies that promote fraudulent pre-IPO offerings often
    use socially engineered, impressive-looking websites, bulletin board postings,
    and email spam to exploit investors who scour the Internet looking for e-businesses
    in which to invest. To lure investors in, they make unfounded comparisons between
    their company and other established, successful Internet companies. But these

    It is not the place to put any money that you cannot afford to lose, such as retirement
    funds, as you can lose most or all of it very quickly. The CFTC has witnessed
    a sharp rise in Forex trading scams in recent years and advises investors on how
    to identify potential fraud. Signs of a possible fraudulent sales pitch include
    most of the same socially engineered pitches and persuasion tactics employed in
    commodity pool fraud. [^(13)](#re_TNF-CH002_CIT00013)

    urges investors to beware of promises of profits from commodity futures and options
    trading based on the events of September 11, 2001, and other terrorist attacks
    as well as public information relating to the war on terrorism. Companies often
    use telephone call solicitations, email messages, Internet advertisements, websites,
    Internet chat room discussions, or radio and television advertisements and infomercials
    to promote commodity futures and options trading. Solicitations may promise quick
    riches, such as turning $5,000 into $20,000 in just a few months with predetermined
    risk. We are aware of pitches that a purchase of futures or options in crude oil
    will be profitable because unrest in oil-producing countries will drive up the
    price of this commodity.

    for commodities due to world events do not necessarily result in the increase
    in value of an option or futures contracts. The market has already factored such
    demand into the price of futures and options. Markets respond immediately to new
    information, within a few minutes or hours. The prices of commodity options and
    futures contracts already take into account all known or predictable market conditions.
    Claims that the risk of purchasing commodity futures and options can be predetermined
    or fixed are misleading. Purchasers of commodity options contracts can lose every
    penny and because futures contracts are leveraged or margined, customers may be
    liable for losses in excess of their initial deposits. [^(14)](#re_TNF-CH002_CIT00014)

- en: In a social engineering attack, an attacker uses basic human interaction (social
    skills) to get a recipient of a message, posting, or advertisement to perform
    a desired action. This can be as simple as opening a file or clicking on a link,
    as with the I Love You attack. It can also involve obtaining compromising information
    about an organization, its operations, or computer systems that is helpful in
    penetrating and attacking networks and systems. In a more complex attack, content
    can be socially engineered to draw the reader into a more complex situation that
    results in fraud or theft. Regardless of the attacker’s desired results, social
    engineering the message has proven to be an effective method to support the criminal
    enterprise or further a social or political agenda.

- en: A good attacker will seem unassuming and respectable, possibly claiming to be
    a new employee, repair person, or researcher, or supporter, and even offering
    credentials to support that identity. However, by asking questions, they often
    piece together enough information to further infiltrate organization operations,
    networks, systems, or data. If an attacker does not harvest enough information
    from one source, they usually contact other sources within the same organization
    utilizing the information from the first source to add to the credibility and
    the appearance of legitimacy. Attackers work on building whatever level of relationship
    necessary to achieve their goals.

- en: Phishing is a form of social engineering that most often uses email, social
    media, or malicious websites to solicit personal information by posing as a legitimate,
    trustworthy organization. One tactic frequently employed is where an attacker
    may send an email, seemingly from a reputable credit card company or financial
    institution, that requests account information, often suggesting that there is
    a problem. When users respond with the requested information, attackers can use
    it to gain further access to accounts or systems.

    as charities or government agencies. Attackers often take advantage of current
    events or certain times of the year, such as natural disasters like Hurricane
    Katrina, or human suffering like epidemics and health scares, economic concerns,
    major political elections, or even holidays. However, phishing attacks can also
    be executed by employees from inside an organization or relatives of employees
    who gain access to organization resources that can be used to collect additional
    information or increase their access. [^(16)](#re_TNF-CH002_CIT00016)

    to be someone else, such as a service technician or fellow employee, and attempts
    to gather information that may seem innocuous to the victim. Social engineers
    may try to collect information about their victims at trade shows or conferences
    related to the victims’ line of work, personal interest, or hobby. Social engineers
    leverage a variety of emotions and human characteristics ranging from the desire
    to be helpful to wanting friendship, or, most often in the case of financial fraud,
    plain old greed on the part of a potential victim.
