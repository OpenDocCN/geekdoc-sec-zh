    users have grown in popularity. These include the offer to fill out a survey for
    an online banking site with a monetary reward if the user includes account information,
    and email messages claiming to be from hotel reward clubs, asking users to verify
    credit card information that a customer may store on the legitimate site for reservation
    purposes. Included in the message is a uniform resource locater (URL) for the
    victim to use, which then directs the user to a site to enter their personal information.
    This site is crafted to closely mimic the look and feel of the legitimate site.
    The information is then collected and used by criminal enterprises. Over time,
    these fake emails and websites have evolved to become more technically deceiving
    to casual investigation.

- en: There is a variety of outcomes that social engineering attackers pursue. Often
    in the past, they were just vandals and delinquents. In 1999, the Melissa computer
    virus, which was widely considered a denial of service attack that was akin to
    juvenile vandalism in its intent. In 2000, The Love Bug virus, however, was much
    more sinister in its intent and was socially engineered to get people to click
    on an attachment to the email. Like Melissa, it targeted Microsoft Outlook users.
    But unlike Melissa, it spread to a victim’s entire address book instead of just
    the first 50 names. It deleted picture and sound files from the hard drive and
    apparently attempted to steal the computer’s password. Perhaps of greatest concern
    is the fact that experts were united in saying that the virus was such a simple
    program that even a sixth grader with Visual Basic scripting knowledge could have
    created it in a few hours. Indeed, the alleged perpetrators were students at a
    computer school without much training who simply copied source codes from previous
    viruses, purportedly with the intention of stealing computer passwords. The Love
    Bug underscored the need to recognize and effectively combat the risks that can
    potentially create severe business disruption, economic calamity, and national
    security breaches.

  zh: 社会工程攻击者追求各种不同的结果。在过去，他们通常只是破坏者和不良分子。1999年，被广泛认为是一种拒绝服务攻击的Melissa计算机病毒，其意图类似于青少年的破坏行为。然而，2000年的“爱情虫”病毒在意图上更加阴险，被社会工程化以诱使人们点击电子邮件附件。与Melissa一样，它针对的是Microsoft
    Outlook用户。但与Melissa不同的是，它传播到受害者的整个通讯录，而不仅仅是前50个名字。它还从硬盘中删除图片和声音文件，并显然试图窃取计算机的密码。最令人担忧的或许是专家们一致认为这个病毒是如此简单的程序，以至于即使一个掌握Visual
    Basic脚本知识的六年级学生也可以在几个小时内创建它。事实上，据称犯罪嫌疑人是一所没有太多培训的计算机学校的学生，他们只是简单地从以前的病毒中复制源代码，据称是为了窃取计算机密码。爱情虫强调了识别和有效打击潜在造成严重业务中断、经济灾难和国家安全漏洞的风险的必要性。
- en: 'Although many will argue the semantics of I LOVE YOU: Was it a virus, a worm,
    or a Trojan Horse? All agreed that it qualified as malicious code, that is, code
    that does something other than what the user wants it to do. The modus operandi
    was very similar to Melissa, in that the malicious code arrived via email, probably
    from someone you knew, with an attachment called LOVE-LETTER-FOR-YOU.TXT.VBS.
    The suffix VBS meant that the attachment was executable code, not just text. Once
    the reader clicked on this file, I LOVE YOU attacked Microsoft Outlook and mailed
    a copy of itself to everyone on the victim’s mailing list, while Melissa just
    used the first 50 names. It infected the software that supports chat rooms so
    that anytime a chat room was set up, I LOVE YOU was sent out to all the chatters.
    It looked for picture, video, and music files to overwrite them with itself, since
    those files tend to get executed more often. It then infected Internet Explorer
    with its password stealing program, which was activated when the system restarted.'

    LOVE YOU就会攻击Microsoft Outlook，并将自身的副本发送给受害者通讯录中的每个人，而Melissa只使用了前50个名字。它感染了支持聊天室的软件，以便每当建立聊天室时，I
    LOVE YOU就会发送给所有聊天者。它搜索图片、视频和音乐文件，用自己覆盖它们，因为这些文件更容易被执行。然后，它利用其窃取密码的程序感染了Internet
    Explorer，在系统重新启动时激活。

    a manner that a social engineer can craft. They may involve the sale of products
    or services, the offering of investments, lottery winnings, found money, or many
    other opportunities. For example, clever con artists will offer to find financing
    arrangements for their clients who pay a finder’s fee in advance. They require
    their clients to sign contracts in which the clients agree to pay the fee when
    they are introduced to the financing source. Victims often learn that they are
    ineligible for financing only after they have paid the finder according to the
    contract. Such agreements may be legal unless it can be shown that the finder

    artificial buying pressure for a targeted security, generally a low-trading volume
    issuer in the ­over-the-counter securities market largely controlled by the fraud
    perpetrators. This artificially increased trading volume has the effect of artificially
    increasing the price of the targeted security (i.e., the pump), which is rapidly
    sold off into the inflated market for the security by the fraud perpetrators (i.e.,
    the dump). This results in illicit gains for the perpetrators and losses for innocent
    third-party investors. Typically, the increased trading volume is generated by
    inducing unwitting investors to purchase shares of the targeted security through
    false or deceptive sales practices and/or public information releases. A modern
    variation on this scheme involves largely foreign-based computer criminals gaining
    unauthorized access to the online brokerage accounts of unsuspecting victims in
    the United States. These victim accounts are then utilized to engage in coordinated
    online purchases of the targeted security to affect the pump portion of a manipulation,
    while the fraud perpetrators sell their pre-existing holdings in the targeted
    security into the inflated market to complete the dump.

  zh: 市场操纵诈骗，通常称为泵浦与倾销，为目标证券创造人为的买入压力，通常是在由欺诈者大部分控制的场外证券市场中的低交易量发行者。 这种人为增加的交易量的效果是人为地增加目标证券的价格（即泵浦），然后由欺诈者（即倾销）迅速在该证券的膨胀市场中出售。
    这给欺诈者带来非法收益，给无辜的第三方投资者带来损失。 通常，增加的交易量是通过诱使不知情的投资者通过虚假或欺骗性的销售做法和/或公开信息发布购买目标证券的股份而产生的。
    这种计划的现代变种涉及主要基于外国的计算机犯罪分子未经授权地访问美国无辜受害者的在线经纪账户。 然后，利用这些受害者账户来进行协调的在线购买目标证券，以影响操纵的泵浦部分，同时欺诈者将他们在目标证券的预先持有份额卖出到膨胀的市场来完成倾销。

    where the fraudster lies about important details (such as the risk of loss, the
    track record of the investment, or the background of the promoter of the scheme).
    Many affinity frauds are Ponzi or pyramid schemes, where money given to the promoter
    by new investors is paid to earlier investors to create the illusion that the
    so-called investment is successful. This tricks new investors into investing in
    the scheme, and lulls existing investors into believing their investments are
    safe. In reality, even if there really is an actual investment, the investment
    typically makes little or no profit. The fraudster simply takes new investors’
    money for their own personal use, often using some of it to pay off existing investors
    who may be growing suspicious. Eventually, when the supply of investor money dries
    up and current investors demand to be paid, the scheme collapses and investors
    discover that most or all of their money is gone.

    entirely on the outcome of a yes/no (binary) proposition. When the binary option
    expires, the option holder will receive either a predetermined amount of cash
    or nothing at all. Given the all-or-nothing payout structure, binary options are
    sometimes referred to as all-or-nothing options or fixed-return options.

    Alert to warn investors about investment scams that purport to offer investors
    the opportunity to buy pre-initial public offering (pre-IPO) shares of companies,

    SEC staff are aware of a number of complaints and inquiries about these types
    of frauds, which may be promoted on social media and Internet sites, by telephone,
    email, in person, or by other means. In September 2010, a judgment order was entered

    more than $3.7 million from 45 investors in four states by offering fake pre-IPO
    shares of companies, including AOL/Time Warner, Inc., Google, Inc., and Rosetta
    Stone, Inc., before the companies went public. Investors should be mindful of
    the risks involved with an offer to purchase pre-IPO shares in a company. Remember
    that the people and companies that promote fraudulent pre-IPO offerings often
    use socially engineered, impressive-looking websites, bulletin board postings,
    and email spam to exploit investors who scour the Internet looking for e-businesses
    in which to invest. To lure investors in, they make unfounded comparisons between
    their company and other established, successful Internet companies. But these
    and other claims that sound so believable at first often turn out to be false

- en: In a social engineering attack, an attacker uses basic human interaction (social
    skills) to get a recipient of a message, posting, or advertisement to perform
    a desired action. This can be as simple as opening a file or clicking on a link,
    as with the I Love You attack. It can also involve obtaining compromising information
    about an organization, its operations, or computer systems that is helpful in
    penetrating and attacking networks and systems. In a more complex attack, content
    can be socially engineered to draw the reader into a more complex situation that
    results in fraud or theft. Regardless of the attacker’s desired results, social
    engineering the message has proven to be an effective method to support the criminal
    enterprise or further a social or political agenda.

- en: A good attacker will seem unassuming and respectable, possibly claiming to be
    a new employee, repair person, or researcher, or supporter, and even offering
    credentials to support that identity. However, by asking questions, they often
    piece together enough information to further infiltrate organization operations,
    networks, systems, or data. If an attacker does not harvest enough information
    from one source, they usually contact other sources within the same organization
    utilizing the information from the first source to add to the credibility and
    the appearance of legitimacy. Attackers work on building whatever level of relationship
    necessary to achieve their goals.

    major political elections, or even holidays. However, phishing attacks can also
