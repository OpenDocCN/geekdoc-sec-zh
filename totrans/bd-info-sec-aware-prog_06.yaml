- en: Data breaches cost money. In some cases, the cost of a data breach is so large
    that it can put a company out of business. The cost of data breaches results from
    industry and regulatory fines such as HIPAA/HITECH and PCI DSS. Other costs result
    from lost of business, state notification laws, and fixing the security issues
    that lead to the breach. Organizations that track cost related to data breaches
    include the Ponemon Institute, Symantec, and Verizon.

    of data breaches, but the only organization that devotes its entire time and budget
    to tracking data breach costs is the Ponemon Institute ([http://www.ponemon.org/](http://www.ponemon.org/)).
    According to the current research, the per record cost of data breaches averaged
    $194.00 in the United States. The Ponemon Institute in partnership with Symantec
    released “Ponemon Cost of Data Breach 2013” in May 2013 [[1](#bb0010)]. The report
    covers data collected worldwide and is further broken down by country.

    mandatory notification of affected parties, and lost of business due to customer

    records including doctors, clinics, dentists, psychologists, chiropractors, and

    Rule applies to any protected health information (PHI) that is in an electronic
    state. Not all specifications from the Security Rule are required. Some are “addressable,”
    meaning that a covered entity can further assess whether the specification is
    reasonable and appropriate for the organization. The term addressable does not
    mean that the specification is optional; rather, it means if it's reasonable based
    on the size and make-up of the organization. Whether required or addressable,
    you should carefully document implementation choices [[4](#bb0025)].

    Rule [[5](#bb0030)], it doesn't mean that your organization should go without
    it. In many cases, as you review regulations specific to your organization, you
    will find that regulations only go so far. Many only address the bare minimum
    of what it takes to make your organization secure. It has been repeated time and
    time again that complying with government and industry regulations alone will
    not make your organization secure, but it will save you a lot of money and is
    often an important first step to building a mature security program.

    protect information remaining at the leased facility by not performing the required
    security evaluation in response to operational changes. In addition, the investigation
    showed a failure to implement appropriate physical safeguards by not having adequate
