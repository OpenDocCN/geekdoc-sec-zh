- en: There is a significant difference between the techniques and methodologies used
    by attackers who have significant time and resources, to those used by penetration
    testers with strict timeframes. These two types of techniques identify very different
    vulnerabilities in the client’s security controls. The challenges are how to provide
    value to the client in a strict timeframe when only short term techniques can
    be employed, and how to help the client defend against long term techniques that
    can’t be realistically simulated. This chapter not only discusses these issues
    in detail, but also provides practical advice for overcoming them.

- en: Choosing which technique and general strategy to use can often depend on how
    much time is available for an attack. Generally speaking, real-world attacks are
    performed over an extended period of time. Attackers carefully plan their approach,
    employing techniques over a number of weeks, months or even years. Whereas, a
    social engineering assessment performed by security consultants often has a very
    strict time frame. This limited amount of time often restricts the approach, what
    techniques can be employed and to what extent they can be performed.

  zh: 短期攻击策略
- en: “Short game” strategies revolve around strict testing parameters, often defined
    by budget constraints (if an assessment is being carried out on behalf of a client)
    or for other general reasons concerning practicality (such as a target only being
    available for a limited amount of time). Strategies of this kind are most commonly
    associated with professional social engineering assessments, whereby consultants
    attempt to provide as much value as possible for the client over just a few days.
    This is the most significant challenge for security companies, providing true
    value for the client. By “value” we mean that the client’s main deliverable, being
    the report, can be used to actually improve security and make a real, measurable
    difference. If a technical infrastructure assessment was performed, the client
    would expect a thorough report of the identified vulnerabilities in order of severity,
    social engineering assessments should be no different.

  zh: “短期策略”围绕着严格的测试参数展开，通常由预算限制（如果代表客户进行评估）或出于其他一般性实用性原因（比如目标仅有有限的时间可用）来定义。这类策略通常与专业社会工程评估相关联，顾问们试图在短短几天内为客户提供尽可能多的价值。这是安全公司面临的最大挑战，为客户提供真正的价值。通过“价值”，我们指的是客户的主要交付物，即报告，可以用来实际改善安全并产生真正可衡量的差异。如果执行了技术基础设施评估，客户将期望按严重程度排序的识别出的漏洞的彻底报告，社会工程评估也不应有任何不同。
- en: If the consultants were to take the approach of real-world attackers, but were
    limited to just a few days, then the report may contain little more than gathered
    evidence from public resources. The reason being that real-world attackers would
    dedicate many months to researching the target. This in itself could be very interesting
    to the client as they may have no idea what potentially sensitive information
    is available on their company and their staff members. However, this may not address
    the most significant risk to the company. Therefore, there is an opportunity to
    provide much greater value for the client by addressing the real risks and making
    the most of the time available.

  zh: 如果顾问们采取了真实世界攻击者的方法，但只限于几天的时间，那么报告可能只包含来自公共资源的收集证据。原因是真实世界的攻击者会花费多个月的时间来研究目标。这本身对客户来说可能非常有趣，因为他们可能不知道关于他们公司和员工的潜在敏感信息。然而，这可能并不能解决公司面临的最大风险。因此，有机会为客户提供更大的价值，通过解决真实的风险并充分利用可用的时间。

  zh: 瞄准正确的领域
- en: An unfortunate side effect of limited time frames is for inexperienced security
    consultants to “smash and grab.” They will neglect threat modeling and, as a result,
    won’t plan anything remotely relevant to the company’s actual risks ([Chapter
    6](CHP006.xhtml) covers the threat modeling process in much greater detail). In
    the limited time available, they will evade detection when breaching security
    in any way they can (usually by tailgating in) on entry and egress and then consider
    the objective met. The resulting report only serves as a “snap shot” with a prediction
    of what they “could have potentially done if they were real attackers”. This leads
    to the client implementing countermeasures based on guesswork. Similarly, some
    security companies will just target a single member of staff to obtain sensitive
    information. The report then details how that specific individual was susceptible
    to some insubstantial pseudoscience-based psychological vulnerability. Occasionally
    this type of approach can be beneficial and it may be what the client actually
    requests, but it only highlights a small set of vulnerabilities or even just a
    single point of “possible” failure. The unfortunate reality is that a lot of testing
    companies work in this way. With a seemingly unlimited scope to “break in” they
    will inevitably reveal one or two new vulnerabilities each time the test is performed.
    This type of dynamic testing could go on indefinitely and could never highlight
    the issues the client really needs to know about. It would be like a penetration
    tester identifying a single vulnerability on one server each time they perform
    the test. This is clearly an inefficient approach and will ultimately fail to
    highlight a business’s true vulnerabilities.

  zh: 有限时间框架的不幸副作用是对经验不足的安全顾问来说，“打砸抢”现象比较严重。他们会忽视威胁建模，结果就是不会规划任何与公司实际风险有关的事情（[第 6
    章](CHP006.xhtml) 对威胁建模过程进行了更详细的介绍）。在有限的时间内，他们会尽可能地规避被发现的可能性，通过任何方式侵犯安全（通常是在进入和离开时搭车），然后认为目标已经达成。由此产生的报告只是一个“快照”，预测了如果他们是真正的攻击者，他们“可能会做些什么”。这导致客户根据猜测实施对策。类似地，一些安全公司只会针对一个员工获取敏感信息。然后报告详细说明了特定个人如何易受一些毫无实质基础的伪科学心理漏洞的影响。偶尔这种方法可能是有益的，而且可能是客户实际请求的内容，但它只突出了一小部分漏洞，甚至只是“可能”的失败点。不幸的现实是很多测试公司都是这样工作的。在看似无限的“入侵”范围内，每次测试都会揭示一两个新的漏洞。这种动态测试可能会永远持续下去，永远无法突出客户真正需要了解的问题。这就像渗透测试人员每次进行测试时只能识别一个服务器上的单个漏洞一样。这显然是一种低效的方法，最终将无法突出企业真正的漏洞。
- en: One reason that testing companies work this way is that too many clients have
    a lack of understanding of how assessments should be performed. This is mainly
    due to the fact that social engineering assessments are still “relatively” unknown.
    Clients have certain expectations regarding standard tests such as infrastructure
    testing or web application testing but still tend to look to the testing company
    to guide them through the social engineering tests. As a result, substandard tests
    may be performed and the client is none the wiser. If the consultants manage to
    easily breach the security of the company then the clients tend to believe that
    the consultants have done a good job. In addition, the “scare factor” when presenting
    such findings to upper management tends to distract from the question as to whether
    the test actually revealed anything of value or anything that can actually be
    fixed.

  zh: 测试公司采用这种方式的一个原因是太多的客户不了解评估应该如何进行。这主要是因为社会工程评估仍然“相对”未知。客户对基础设施测试或Web应用程序测试等标准测试有一定的期望，但仍然倾向于让测试公司指导他们完成社会工程测试。结果可能进行了低水平的测试，而客户却对此一无所知。如果顾问们轻易突破了公司的安全防线，那么客户往往会认为顾问们做得不错。此外，向高层管理人员呈现这样的发现时的“恐吓因素”往往会分散注意力，使人们忽略测试是否实际上揭示了任何有价值的东西或任何可以修复的东西。
- en: Suppose a business decides to hire security consultants to test their susceptibility
    to social engineering. The consultants smooth talk past reception, attach to the
    corporate network and escalate their privileges. They manage to exit the building
    in possession of a customer database on their laptop. The management team’s reaction
    is one of shock and fear. The management team would make comments such as “What
    if a real attacker was to do this? The damage to our reputation could cripple
    the business, never mind the loss of sensitive information!”. The business then
    follows all the advice of the testing company, from implementing staff awareness
    training through to improved physical and technical security controls. The very
    next day, social engineers arrive at the warehouse behind the same building dressed
    as delivery drivers with all the valid credentials. They chat with the warehouse
    staff, load their truck with goods and drive away without incident. The original
    social engineering test highlighted a “possible” sequence of events that could
    damage the business but not a very likely one. The chances of a social engineer
    breaking into the building to steal the customer database is relatively low. Whereas,
    the risk of theft for this particular company is relatively high, when considering
    the value of the goods they store. Had the testing company and the business conducted
    threat modeling, the likely threat of warehouse theft would have been highlighted.
    Social engineering is not just about breaching buildings and networks, it’s about
    breaching security in general. This is not to say that the original social engineering
    test was a complete waste of time, it is simply saying that the efforts could
    have been prioritized elsewhere. The tests should have been designed to identify
    vulnerabilities in the warehouse procedures and awareness training. Once the most
    significant risks have been assessed, the lower risks can then be examined.

  zh: 假设一家企业决定雇佣安全顾问来测试他们对社会工程的易受攻击性。顾问们巧舌如簧地通过了前台，连接到了公司网络并提升了他们的权限。他们设法离开大楼，携带着一份客户数据库在他们的笔记本电脑上。管理团队的反应是震惊和恐惧。管理团队会发表诸如“如果一个真正的攻击者这样做会怎样？我们的声誉损失可能会摧毁业务，更不用说敏感信息的丢失！”之类的评论。企业随后采纳了测试公司的所有建议，从实施员工意识培训到改进物理和技术安全控制措施。第二天，社会工程师以同样的方式来到了大楼后面的仓库，装扮成送货司机，并携带所有有效的凭证。他们与仓库员工聊天，将他们的卡车装满货物，毫无事故地驾驶离开。最初的社会工程测试突出显示了可能损害业务的一系列事件，但并非非常可能发生的事件。社会工程师闯入大楼窃取客户数据库的机会相对较低。而对于这家特定公司来说，偷窃的风险相对较高，考虑到他们存储的货物价值。如果测试公司和企业进行了威胁建模，那么仓库盗窃的可能威胁就会被突出显示。社会工程不仅仅是关于闯入建筑物和网络，而是关于一般安全的突破。这并不是说最初的社会工程测试完全是浪费时间，而是说努力可以优先考虑其他地方。测试应该旨在识别仓库程序和意识培训中的漏洞。一旦评估了最重要的风险，那么就可以检查较低的风险了。

    may also follow this structure. However, more complex engagements, such as breaching
    building security, wouldn’t necessarily be performed in this order. The reconnaissance
    may lead to initial attacks, which then feeds information back into reconnaissance
    to help design new attacks. To enable effective time allocating you need to fully
    understand the process of the engagements you plan on performing. In addition,
    if you have been tasked with assessing security over multiple attack vectors,
    then it’s important to understand how they relate to one another.

  zh: 基本攻击，例如通过电话获取特定信息的攻击，也可能遵循这种结构。然而，更复杂的参与，例如入侵建筑安全，不一定按照这个顺序执行。侦察可能导致初始攻击，然后将信息反馈到侦察中，以帮助设计新的攻击。为了有效分配时间，您需要充分了解您计划执行的参与过程。此外，如果您被要求评估多个攻击向量的安全性，则了解它们如何相互关联也很重要。
- en: One approach is to string attack vectors together. For example, the initial
    reconnaissance may provide the information required to enable basic phishing and
    telephone attacks. The results of these attacks may aid targeted attacks, such
    as spear phishing e-mails. The sensitive information gained from the targeted
    attacks can then be used to design scenarios for physical attacks against the
    building. By feeding the results of each attack vector into the next you use the
    time you have effectively while covering multiple areas. Each stage of this method
    can represent a single day in terms of time. Therefore, a full assessment might
    well be conducted over as little as 5 days, with the final day reserved for the
    report writing. However, although this is an efficient way of working, it only
    identifies vulnerabilities that manifest as a result of such a sequential attack
    strategy. For example, it doesn’t realistically simulate an attacker’s strategy
    aimed at a single attack vector. If an attacker had no intention of breaching
    the security of the building and only wanted to obtain sensitive information via
    telephone, then they may use very different set of techniques to achieve different
    objectives. If individual vectors are to be assessed, then they should be treated
    individually, with separate reconnaissance and scenario execution time allocated
    to them. Therefore, assessing all three major vectors could result in a 9-day
    assessment including report writing time.

  zh: 一种方法是将攻击向量串联在一起。例如，初始侦察可能提供所需信息，以启用基本的钓鱼和电话攻击。这些攻击的结果可能有助于定向攻击，如针对性的钓鱼邮件。从定向攻击中获得的敏感信息然后可以用来设计对建筑物的物理攻击场景。通过将每个攻击向量的结果输入到下一个中，您可以有效利用您拥有的时间，同时覆盖多个领域。这种方法的每个阶段在时间上可以表示一天。因此，完整的评估可能仅需5天，最后一天用于撰写报告。然而，尽管这是一种有效的工作方式，但它只识别出由于这种顺序攻击策略而产生的漏洞。例如，它并不能真实地模拟针对单个攻击向量的攻击者策略。如果攻击者没有意图侵入建筑物的安全，而只是想通过电话获取敏感信息，那么他们可能会使用非常不同的技术来实现不同的目标。如果要评估单个向量，则应将其单独处理，为其分配单独的侦察和情景执行时间。因此，评估所有三个主要向量可能会导致一个为期9天的评估，包括报告撰写时间。

    This is information such as potential target’s names and contact details. If you
    have unlimited time to perform reconnaissance, what other information would be
    useful? The short answer to this question would be; any information that is deemed
    useful. However, some types of information are more useful than others. If you

- en: The initial reconnaissance should reveal a large number of potential targets,
    including their name, position and contact information. This is often the only
    information gathered during short game attack scenarios. If an attacker wanted
    to send a phishing e-mail to company, they may only require the e-mail addresses.
    However, each individual staff member has a lifetime of useful information that
    could be used against them specifically or against the company they work for.
    If you can access this information, perhaps through social media or by building
    a relationship with them, then you can use it against them.

    life in order to attack the business they work for. A great deal of this kind
    of information can be gathered from social media websites as they are essentially
    a database of our lives. It is generally more difficult these days to extract
    such potentially sensitive information from social media websites, mainly due
    to ever increasing security controls. In order to access the information you want
    you first have to be associated with the target, be it as a “friend” or some other
    type of symbolic link associated with the social media website. Usually this requires
    both a request and confirmation stage to take place before the link can be made.
    Unfortunately, there is little security in place to prevent fake social media
    profiles. Therefore, an attacker can create a fake profile to establish a connection
    with a victim. Once the connection has been established, the victim’s account
    can then be scraped for useful information.

    A quick and simple last-minute change could be to the secondary school attended,
    made to match the victim the link request is sent to. As these types of accounts
    tend to be premade then this could be considered a “short game” technique. However,

    on short assessments lasting as little as a few days, these techniques are not
    entirely practical. To truly leverage the power of information elicitation you
    have to engage with the target multiple times, developing the relationship and
    guiding the conversations in the direction that reveals the information you are
    wanting. Of course, a good “elicitor” could glean information from a single conversation
    with a complete stranger, but it is not a reliable enough technique to employ

    but it could be used to gain credibility as part of an attack scenario. In addition,
    discussing the current state of the business’s equipment isn’t something you would
    normally do with nonemployees. In the same conversation the employee may mention
    the manufacturer of that same phone system. Again, this information could be useful
    to a social engineer and the employee wouldn’t normally reveal it to strangers.
    The reason they do reveal this information, without realizing they’ve caused a

- en: A frequently used cliché in surveillance is the use of binoculars or even a
    telescope to watch an employee’s keyboard strokes through a window. The idea is
    that you will be able to see them enter their password and use this to your advantage.
    How practical is this? Typically, of all of the employees in a business, only
    a handful will have the privileges of a “domain admin” user. It is this level
    of privilege that is required to quickly and efficiently compromise the network
    (assuming that it is a Microsoft Windows domain). Therefore, you may be looking
    through a lot of office windows before you come across a valuable password. In
    addition, you have no real way of fully confirming if that password is a highly
    privileged user. However, if the business has a remotely accessible service such
    as a business e-mail or VPN portal, then potentially even a standard user’s credentials
    could access it (provided it doesn’t have two-factor authentication). If you can
    gain access to a user’s e-mail account then you can use it to launch further phishing
    e-mail attacks. Chances are that passwords will be reused, so you may well gain
    access to additional services such as the user’s eBay, Amazon or even PayPal account.
    If you do gain access to the building, then at the very least you should be able
    to use a standard user’s credentials to logon to a free workstation. Launching
    attacks from a workstation is generally less suspicious than plugging your laptop
    or “dropbox” into the network, unless of course you can do it without being seen.

- en: Similarly to watching employees enter passwords, another common use of surveillance
    is to watch employees enter codes into keypads (simplex locks, etc.). In high-security
    environments such as banks, these locks are often mounted horizontally, so it
    is difficult to see the pad from a distance. However, strangely enough in the
    vast majority of cases they are mounted vertically on the wall for all to see.
    Sitting in your car in the car park with a good pair of binoculars may be all
    that’s required to see the code being entered. Sometimes, a keypad will be used
    on the car park barriers as well. If you ever see these locks in use, it is essential
    that you highlight the vulnerability to the client. They can then weigh up the
    cost of the countermeasure (replacement with radio-frequency identification (RFID)
    or mounting horizontally) to the risk of an attacker using the code to gain access.

- en: If you are performing a social engineering security assessment then you may
    well be confined to “short game” attack strategies. Although these may not be
    entirely realistic, it is still very possible to provide great value for the client.
    To accomplish this it is essential that you target the most relevant areas and
    use the little time you have effectively. Ultimately, your assessment needs to
    provide the information necessary to have the greatest impact on the client’s
    overall security posture.

  zh: 如果你正在进行社会工程安全评估，那么你可能会被限制在“短期攻击”策略中。尽管这些可能并不完全现实，但仍然有可能为客户提供巨大的价值。为了实现这一点，你需要针对最相关的领域，并有效利用你所拥有的时间。最终，你的评估需要提供必要的信息，以对客户的整体安全状况产生最大影响。
- en: If you are a real-world attacker with no time restrictions, then the methods
    you can employ are devastatingly effective. The more time you take, spanning your
    attacks over weeks or months, the more likely you are to succeed. If, as a client,
    you want to explore the risks associated with “long game” attack techniques then
    you essentially have two options. You can either invest a large sum of money into
    an extended social engineering assessment or you can take a “risk management”
    approach and address the issues as more of a paper exercise. However, remember
    that social engineering professionals can provide great insight into possible
    “long game” attacks, so as to make paper exercises more accurate and relevant.

  zh: 如果你是一个没有时间限制的现实世界的攻击者，那么你可以采用的方法是极其有效的。你花费的时间越多，将攻击时间跨度延长到几周甚至几个月，成功的可能性就越大。如果作为客户，你想探索与“长期攻击”技术相关的风险，那么你基本上有两个选择。你可以投入大笔资金进行长期社会工程评估，或者你可以采取“风险管理”方法，将问题更多地视为一种纸上演习。然而，请记住，社会工程专业人员可以为可能的“长期攻击”提供深刻见解，以使纸上演习更准确和相关。
