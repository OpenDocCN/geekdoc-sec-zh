- en: There is a significant difference between the techniques and methodologies used
    by attackers who have significant time and resources, to those used by penetration
    testers with strict timeframes. These two types of techniques identify very different
    vulnerabilities in the client’s security controls. The challenges are how to provide
    value to the client in a strict timeframe when only short term techniques can
    be employed, and how to help the client defend against long term techniques that
    can’t be realistically simulated. This chapter not only discusses these issues
    in detail, but also provides practical advice for overcoming them.

- en: Choosing which technique and general strategy to use can often depend on how
    much time is available for an attack. Generally speaking, real-world attacks are
    performed over an extended period of time. Attackers carefully plan their approach,
    employing techniques over a number of weeks, months or even years. Whereas, a
    social engineering assessment performed by security consultants often has a very
    strict time frame. This limited amount of time often restricts the approach, what
    techniques can be employed and to what extent they can be performed.

- en: “Short game” strategies revolve around strict testing parameters, often defined
    by budget constraints (if an assessment is being carried out on behalf of a client)
    or for other general reasons concerning practicality (such as a target only being
    available for a limited amount of time). Strategies of this kind are most commonly
    associated with professional social engineering assessments, whereby consultants
    attempt to provide as much value as possible for the client over just a few days.
    This is the most significant challenge for security companies, providing true
    value for the client. By “value” we mean that the client’s main deliverable, being
    the report, can be used to actually improve security and make a real, measurable
    difference. If a technical infrastructure assessment was performed, the client
    would expect a thorough report of the identified vulnerabilities in order of severity,
    social engineering assessments should be no different.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If the consultants were to take the approach of real-world attackers, but were
    limited to just a few days, then the report may contain little more than gathered
    evidence from public resources. The reason being that real-world attackers would
    dedicate many months to researching the target. This in itself could be very interesting
    to the client as they may have no idea what potentially sensitive information
    is available on their company and their staff members. However, this may not address
    the most significant risk to the company. Therefore, there is an opportunity to
    provide much greater value for the client by addressing the real risks and making
    the most of the time available.

- en: An unfortunate side effect of limited time frames is for inexperienced security
    consultants to “smash and grab.” They will neglect threat modeling and, as a result,
    won’t plan anything remotely relevant to the company’s actual risks ([Chapter
    6](CHP006.xhtml) covers the threat modeling process in much greater detail). In
    the limited time available, they will evade detection when breaching security
    in any way they can (usually by tailgating in) on entry and egress and then consider
    the objective met. The resulting report only serves as a “snap shot” with a prediction
    of what they “could have potentially done if they were real attackers”. This leads
    to the client implementing countermeasures based on guesswork. Similarly, some
    security companies will just target a single member of staff to obtain sensitive
    information. The report then details how that specific individual was susceptible
    to some insubstantial pseudoscience-based psychological vulnerability. Occasionally
    this type of approach can be beneficial and it may be what the client actually
    requests, but it only highlights a small set of vulnerabilities or even just a
    single point of “possible” failure. The unfortunate reality is that a lot of testing
    companies work in this way. With a seemingly unlimited scope to “break in” they
    will inevitably reveal one or two new vulnerabilities each time the test is performed.
    This type of dynamic testing could go on indefinitely and could never highlight
    the issues the client really needs to know about. It would be like a penetration
    tester identifying a single vulnerability on one server each time they perform
    the test. This is clearly an inefficient approach and will ultimately fail to
    highlight a business’s true vulnerabilities.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One reason that testing companies work this way is that too many clients have
    a lack of understanding of how assessments should be performed. This is mainly
    due to the fact that social engineering assessments are still “relatively” unknown.
    Clients have certain expectations regarding standard tests such as infrastructure
    testing or web application testing but still tend to look to the testing company
    to guide them through the social engineering tests. As a result, substandard tests
    may be performed and the client is none the wiser. If the consultants manage to
    easily breach the security of the company then the clients tend to believe that
    the consultants have done a good job. In addition, the “scare factor” when presenting
    such findings to upper management tends to distract from the question as to whether
    the test actually revealed anything of value or anything that can actually be
    fixed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Suppose a business decides to hire security consultants to test their susceptibility
    to social engineering. The consultants smooth talk past reception, attach to the
    corporate network and escalate their privileges. They manage to exit the building
    in possession of a customer database on their laptop. The management team’s reaction
    is one of shock and fear. The management team would make comments such as “What
    if a real attacker was to do this? The damage to our reputation could cripple
    the business, never mind the loss of sensitive information!”. The business then
    follows all the advice of the testing company, from implementing staff awareness
    training through to improved physical and technical security controls. The very
    next day, social engineers arrive at the warehouse behind the same building dressed
    as delivery drivers with all the valid credentials. They chat with the warehouse
    staff, load their truck with goods and drive away without incident. The original
    social engineering test highlighted a “possible” sequence of events that could
    damage the business but not a very likely one. The chances of a social engineer
    breaking into the building to steal the customer database is relatively low. Whereas,
    the risk of theft for this particular company is relatively high, when considering
    the value of the goods they store. Had the testing company and the business conducted
    threat modeling, the likely threat of warehouse theft would have been highlighted.
    Social engineering is not just about breaching buildings and networks, it’s about
    breaching security in general. This is not to say that the original social engineering
    test was a complete waste of time, it is simply saying that the efforts could
    have been prioritized elsewhere. The tests should have been designed to identify
    vulnerabilities in the warehouse procedures and awareness training. Once the most
    significant risks have been assessed, the lower risks can then be examined.

    may also follow this structure. However, more complex engagements, such as breaching
    building security, wouldn’t necessarily be performed in this order. The reconnaissance
    may lead to initial attacks, which then feeds information back into reconnaissance
    to help design new attacks. To enable effective time allocating you need to fully
    understand the process of the engagements you plan on performing. In addition,
    if you have been tasked with assessing security over multiple attack vectors,
    then it’s important to understand how they relate to one another.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One approach is to string attack vectors together. For example, the initial
    reconnaissance may provide the information required to enable basic phishing and
    telephone attacks. The results of these attacks may aid targeted attacks, such
    as spear phishing e-mails. The sensitive information gained from the targeted
    attacks can then be used to design scenarios for physical attacks against the
    building. By feeding the results of each attack vector into the next you use the
    time you have effectively while covering multiple areas. Each stage of this method
    can represent a single day in terms of time. Therefore, a full assessment might
    well be conducted over as little as 5 days, with the final day reserved for the
    report writing. However, although this is an efficient way of working, it only
    identifies vulnerabilities that manifest as a result of such a sequential attack
    strategy. For example, it doesn’t realistically simulate an attacker’s strategy
    aimed at a single attack vector. If an attacker had no intention of breaching
    the security of the building and only wanted to obtain sensitive information via
    telephone, then they may use very different set of techniques to achieve different
    objectives. If individual vectors are to be assessed, then they should be treated
    individually, with separate reconnaissance and scenario execution time allocated
    to them. Therefore, assessing all three major vectors could result in a 9-day
    assessment including report writing time.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If a client does not have budget constraints and requests an assessment that
    spans over weeks or months, then it may be possible to take both approaches. Individual

  prefs: []

- en: The way in which you allocate your time ultimately depends on what the client’s

    professional security assessments and are generally confined to the realm of real-world
    attacks.
  prefs: []

    techniques to achieve difficult objectives with minimal risk. For example, calling

    In contrast, watching the victim’s computer screen and keyboard from across the
    road using a telescope or binoculars could achieve the same objective, but with
    far less overall risk of being caught.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another way in which “long game” techniques are used is to divide “short game”
    techniques into smaller parts or stages so as to avoid detection. For example,
    a spear phishing e-mail designed to obtain sensitive information could raise alarms
    if the receiver spots it for what it is. Whereas, a series of seemingly harmless
    and innocuous e-mails sent over an extended period of time could obtain the same

    book. The greater the reconnaissance, the greater the chances of a successful
    attack. There are certain pieces of information that are critical to most social
    engineering attacks and these often form the basis for short game techniques.
    This is information such as potential target’s names and contact details. If you
    have unlimited time to perform reconnaissance, what other information would be
    useful? The short answer to this question would be; any information that is deemed
    useful. However, some types of information are more useful than others. If you
    are able to expand your research you should be able to gather information that
    will significantly support your attacks.

    life in order to attack the business they work for. A great deal of this kind
    of information can be gathered from social media websites as they are essentially
    a database of our lives. It is generally more difficult these days to extract
    such potentially sensitive information from social media websites, mainly due
    to ever increasing security controls. In order to access the information you want
    you first have to be associated with the target, be it as a “friend” or some other
    type of symbolic link associated with the social media website. Usually this requires
    both a request and confirmation stage to take place before the link can be made.
    Unfortunately, there is little security in place to prevent fake social media
    profiles. Therefore, an attacker can create a fake profile to establish a connection
    with a victim. Once the connection has been established, the victim’s account
    can then be scraped for useful information.

    a great deal of time to develop a fake account. For the account to be convincing
    it will need detailed profile information, posts, photos and links with other
    accounts. It is challenging to create a convincing fake account without the basic
    content that is generated over a long period of time. In addition, targets may
    not necessarily check their social media accounts regularly or respond to link
    requests straight away.

    may have already prepared for use in assessments. They are structured to be bait
    for a large demographic of targets. For example, the profile image could be that
    of a young pretty girl, aimed at the male targets of a business and vice versa.
    A quick and simple last-minute change could be to the secondary school attended,
    made to match the victim the link request is sent to. As these types of accounts
    tend to be premade then this could be considered a “short game” technique. However,
    the accounts tend to be quite generic, therefore it would be difficult to use
    such accounts to target a specific person or organization.

    match that of the employees of that business. The link request to the target could
    come with a message saying, “*Hi, spoke to you at the charity event last week…
    can’t believe how much money we raised!*”

    a real individual, providing of course they haven’t already made an account. If
    your reconnaissance reveals an employee that has not created an account, then
    there is little to stop you doing it for them. The other employees of the business
    are likely to recognize the individual and accept any link requests. Eventually
    the real individual we become aware of this fake account, but by then you will
    have scraped all the potentially sensitive information from all the other employee’s
    accounts. In a sense, this is a very risky approach but the rewards can sometimes
    make it worth while.

    Generally speaking, organization’s accounts don’t raise as much suspicion as general
    user’s accounts. Creating a fake account for a third-party company you know a
    target business uses could quickly result in links being made with all the employees.

    they do have other uses. Established accounts with good connections to the target
    business could also be used to gain credibility in other attacks. For example,
    you could mention something regarding your account or a post the target had submitted
    to gain credibility when on the phone to them. In addition, social media websites
    are another possible vector of attack. If you notice an employee is currently
    browsing a social media website (perhaps from the chat panel) then you could potentially
    send a malicious link, which could result in you gaining access to the work computer
    they are using. After all, how likely is it that the business conducts awareness
    and training that includes content covering attacks over this medium?

    However, techniques of this kind are usually employed in casual conversations
    and often benefit greatly from an established relationship with the target. Therefore,
    on short assessments lasting as little as a few days, these techniques are not
    entirely practical. To truly leverage the power of information elicitation you
    have to engage with the target multiple times, developing the relationship and
    guiding the conversations in the direction that reveals the information you are
    wanting. Of course, a good “elicitor” could glean information from a single conversation
    with a complete stranger, but it is not a reliable enough technique to employ
    when time is very restricted. Therefore, as this book is focused on social engineering
    assessment techniques, information elicitation of this kind is confined to the
    “long game” category.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These techniques are designed to obtain information that, although isn’t very
    sensitive, is still information that the target wouldn’t normally reveal. For
    example, in casual conversation with an employee you may learn, through these
    techniques, that the phone system is broken. This isn’t very sensitive information
    but it could be used to gain credibility as part of an attack scenario. In addition,
    discussing the current state of the business’s equipment isn’t something you would
    normally do with nonemployees. In the same conversation the employee may mention
    the manufacturer of that same phone system. Again, this information could be useful
    to a social engineer and the employee wouldn’t normally reveal it to strangers.
    The reason they do reveal this information, without realizing they’ve caused a
    breach, is due to the techniques of elicitation. We will now cover some of the
    most common techniques that can be used.

    may obtain sensitive information from the target’s defense. For example, you could
    comment that *“I seriously doubt they’ll ever merge with company xyz, they don’t
    have the basic business sense…”* which could be met with “*You couldn’t be more
    wrong, they do have keen business sense and meetings have already been arranged!*”

    result in obtaining useful information and also makes you appear to be less of
    a threat.

    with a simple “Yes” or “No”, so that the target is likely to give more information.
    For example, if you wanted to know what version of web browser is being used,
    rather than asking “*Do you use Internet Explorer 8.0?*” You could instead ask
    “*Have you found the latest version of Internet Explorer to be more stable?*”.
    The first question could be answered with a simple yes or no and may be a little
    suspicious. The second question requires some thought to answer and may well reveal
    the information you’re after.

    such as the business e-mail structure, out-of-office automatic responses and additional
    employee contact details. Following this, targeted phishing e-mails are sent to
    harvest credentials or direct the target to malicious websites. However, both
    of these approaches are “short game” techniques, as the entire process from initial
    e-mails to backdoor access can actually be completed in as little a few hours.
    How would the approach differ if the attacker was not limited by time?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The approach to phishing attacks mentioned above does not necessarily require
    an established relationship with the target, even when targeting specific individuals.
    Obviously, if the phishing e-mail is spoofed to appear to come from the target’s
    colleague, then you are leveraging the trust relationship they have. However,
    if you could build the relationship yourself and ultimately know the target better,
    then you would stand a far greater chance of success. Extended spear phishing
    attacks will slowly build up a dialogue between you and the target, develop a
    relationship and will inevitably reveal the perfect approach to manipulation.

    information by posing as a university student. They would contact the target via

    information. This approach comes with some risk. The employees you contact could
    refuse to give information and the more employees you contact the greater the
    chances of invoking suspicion.

    like this from an employee rather than from a generic e-mail address. This initial
    contact should provide you with your first target and the structure of their e-mails.
    If you are lucky, the response will include further contact details for employees
    that “*May be able to help you*”. Or you may be told that your request has been
    forwarded on to other employees that will be contacting you soon. Hopefully your
    e-mail will begin to circulate around the business as each employee attempts to
    avoid the responsibility by passing it on to their colleagues. Eventually, when
    you do establish a dialogue with someone willing to provide information, the previous
    e-mail chain creates credibility and the chain of authentication effect also applies.

    if the business has followed strict and thorough employee dismissal procedures

    level of access they failed to remove, such as computer network backdoors they

    engineers, making the impersonation even easier. All the social engineer needs
    to do is convincingly impersonate a third-party contractor (which could be little
    more than polo shirt with their logo) and devise a decent pretext. The ease of
    this approach makes it possibly one of the most common physical attacks against
    businesses. Scenarios based around contractor visits are identifying weaknesses
    in the visitor/contractor sign-in and validation procedures. Sadly, simply arriving
    onsite and explaining that you’ve been called to look at a printer can sometimes
    be enough to gain access, though the authors would never recommend such an approach.
    See [Chapter 7](CHP007.xhtml) for a breakdown of building targeted scenarios.

    requests or even to sell more services and products. If you can successfully impersonate
    a third-party company then you could obtain very useful information. For example,
    if your reconnaissance has revealed the target company use a particular manufacturer
    of printer, you could impersonate a sales representative asking them if the equipment
    is meeting their expectations. From that one phone call you could potentially

- en: Long-term surveillance is an age-old technique for gathering information. Various
    spy films have seen investigators on “stake outs” watching a target from across
    the road through blinds or using zoom lenses to capture photos from afar. The
    risk is relatively low, provided you are well hidden and you have plenty of time
    on your hands then these methods can gather a lot of information. However, how
    do these methods relate to attacking businesses? Before the authors can give any
    practical advice regarding these methods, we first need to dispel some of the
    common clichés.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Secret surveillance and high-powered lenses may be advantageous if you’re trying
    to learn the layout of a high-security military complex. However, when attacking
    the average business, you need only walk your dog past the front door to see all
    the cameras, security guards, entrances and exits. You can even walk into reception
    and ask for directions to see the layout and all the possible weak points. Therefore,
    long-term surveillance isn’t really that useful for the initial reconnaissance
    stage of the attack. As far as an assessment goes, simple photography of the building
    and information from Google Maps will likely suffice.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A frequently used cliché in surveillance is the use of binoculars or even a
    telescope to watch an employee’s keyboard strokes through a window. The idea is
    that you will be able to see them enter their password and use this to your advantage.
    How practical is this? Typically, of all of the employees in a business, only
    a handful will have the privileges of a “domain admin” user. It is this level
    of privilege that is required to quickly and efficiently compromise the network
    (assuming that it is a Microsoft Windows domain). Therefore, you may be looking
    through a lot of office windows before you come across a valuable password. In
    addition, you have no real way of fully confirming if that password is a highly
    privileged user. However, if the business has a remotely accessible service such
    as a business e-mail or VPN portal, then potentially even a standard user’s credentials
    could access it (provided it doesn’t have two-factor authentication). If you can
    gain access to a user’s e-mail account then you can use it to launch further phishing
    e-mail attacks. Chances are that passwords will be reused, so you may well gain
    access to additional services such as the user’s eBay, Amazon or even PayPal account.
    If you do gain access to the building, then at the very least you should be able
    to use a standard user’s credentials to logon to a free workstation. Launching
    attacks from a workstation is generally less suspicious than plugging your laptop
    or “dropbox” into the network, unless of course you can do it without being seen.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Similarly to watching employees enter passwords, another common use of surveillance
    is to watch employees enter codes into keypads (simplex locks, etc.). In high-security
    environments such as banks, these locks are often mounted horizontally, so it
    is difficult to see the pad from a distance. However, strangely enough in the
    vast majority of cases they are mounted vertically on the wall for all to see.
    Sitting in your car in the car park with a good pair of binoculars may be all
    that’s required to see the code being entered. Sometimes, a keypad will be used
    on the car park barriers as well. If you ever see these locks in use, it is essential
    that you highlight the vulnerability to the client. They can then weigh up the
    cost of the countermeasure (replacement with radio-frequency identification (RFID)
    or mounting horizontally) to the risk of an attacker using the code to gain access.
    Don’t waste days trying to capture someone entering the code if a 5-min conversation
    with the client will establish the risk and allow them to make a good business
    decision.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another vulnerability associated with keypad locks arises when the code is not
    regularly changed. Eventually the buttons become worn so an attacker can see which
    digits are being pressed. This reduces the amount of possible combinations to
    just a few.

- en: If time is not a limited resource then the best approach is to combine long-term
    surveillance with the concept of turning innocuous information into sensitive
    information. Suppose you have rented a room across the road and have good visibility
    of the target office space using a telescope. Generally speaking, you will see
    employees working away, typing at their desks, having conversations at the water
    cooler, filing papers in cabinets, etc. However, if you know what to look for
    then you can gather some great pieces of information.

    Suppose you notice that the employees bring biscuits in every Friday and lay them
    out on a table. When calling your target and impersonating an employee credibility
    could be gained by jovially saying something as simple as “So, how many biscuits
    did you eat today?”. Sometimes the less obvious and totally innocuous pieces of
    information such as “Friday biscuits” can be more valuable than passwords.

    well be confined to “short game” attack strategies. Although these may not be
    entirely realistic, it is still very possible to provide great value for the client.
    To accomplish this it is essential that you target the most relevant areas and
    use the little time you have effectively. Ultimately, your assessment needs to
    provide the information necessary to have the greatest impact on the client’s
    overall security posture.

    you can employ are devastatingly effective. The more time you take, spanning your
    attacks over weeks or months, the more likely you are to succeed. If, as a client,
    you want to explore the risks associated with “long game” attack techniques then
    you essentially have two options. You can either invest a large sum of money into
    an extended social engineering assessment or you can take a “risk management”
    approach and address the issues as more of a paper exercise. However, remember
    that social engineering professionals can provide great insight into possible
    “long game” attacks, so as to make paper exercises more accurate and relevant.
