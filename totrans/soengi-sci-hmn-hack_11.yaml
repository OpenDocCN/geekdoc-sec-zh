    phishing scams are on the rise, it is time to harden against those with education
    and proper policies. No matter what the cause of the breaches you read about,

    to your infrastructure to see where there are weaknesses.

    this point. After working with Josh for a while, it became easier to identify
    behaviors and situations that would put my progress at risk. For example, not
    counting my calories throughout the day or trying to guess at a portion rather
    than weighing it were generally minor behaviors that could lead to a lack of proper
    gains. On the other hand, going to an all-you-can-eat pizza buffet and trying
    to convince myself I would stop after two slices would be a major setback.

    to make sure I make better decisions in early parts of the day, so I don't blow

    and having overall better health. That reward is a good motivator for me to keep
    going with the program. Not every employee will feel the same reward for “catching
    the phish” or “reporting the vish.” It's not because they don't care or hate the
    company—it's just that some people are so busy they may view training programs
    as a time-wasting necessary evil.

    company I worked with, a department manager made it very clear that he hated the
    testing we were doing. As a result, his department of 450 people seemed to be
    one of the largest threats to the company. Malware, phishing, and other attacks
    often caused problems in this department.

    wanted to use a methodology of shame and embarrassment by calling out the worst
    offenders. I have never seen that methodology work effectively—normally, it creates
    an adversarial relationship between the manager and team. In those cases, compliance,
    if it is given at all, is a result of fear, anger, or resentment. In a meeting
    with the client, I asked about trying a quick game with their call center team.
    I said I would send them a plush fish doll, and I wanted them to announce that
    the first person to *not click* and *to report* the phish each month would get
    the fish at his or her cubicle. That person would be labeled the “King Phisher”
    for the month.

    the employees were actively looking for the phish, reporting went from a mere
    average of 7% to more than 87% in a few months. Clicking went down from about
    57% to less than 10% in that same time. And the most rewarding outcome was that
    actual malware that was found on the network dropped by more than 79%.

    or it can lack motivating force if the reward is something not useful or too insignificant.
    In one organization, they tried to give away one $5 gift card per quarter to those
    who stayed in the ideal behavior group for the whole quarter. The gift was too
    small to be a motivator. The reward needs to motivate, but that doesn''t mean
    it has to be a brand-new 60-inch flat-screen TV or a year''s salary. It just has
    to be something that represents how much you appreciate the actions and attitude

    you invite me, please have salad or something healthy so Josh won''t get mad at
    me), and they have a short speech or video or presentation about some security
    topic that benefits those who attend. Sure, those who attend may do so at first
    for the free food, but the sessions I have attended always ended with many people
    being able to take at least one bit of useful information away. It is also a great
    opportunity for you to reinforce the concepts and actions you want the employees
    to take.'

- en: '**Top-down Reinforcement** This one seems to have almost mystical powers, as
    if you put a spell on your population. When the CEO lets the group know they are
    also getting phished with the employee population each month and how he or she
    fared, it gives a very clear message of “we are in this together … for reals.”
    In one organization I worked with, the initial reaction to the phishing program
    was less than ideal. In one extreme case, a woman who took all the wrong actions
    when receiving the phish was so angry, she demanded that I get on the phone, and
    she spent 10 minutes chewing me out. She told me what an awful person I am and
    how I need to reevaluate my life course. A few months later, the CEO of this massive
    organization held an all hands corporate meeting. In that meeting, the CEO mentioned
    the phishing program; he explained that he got phished like everyone else, and
    he was learning that he needed to be more aware. As if some mystical talisman
    was waved over the population, anger ceased to exist, aggression toward my SE
    team was lessened drastically, and we saw a much larger percentage of compliance.
    Sometimes the population feels they are being singled out to be made to look dumb.
    This can cause an adversarial relationship, and getting the top management of
    the company to support the initiative can really help.'
