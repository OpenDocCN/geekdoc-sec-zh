    if it is given at all, is a result of fear, anger, or resentment. In a meeting
    with the client, I asked about trying a quick game with their call center team.
    I said I would send them a plush fish doll, and I wanted them to announce that
    the first person to *not click* and *to report* the phish each month would get
    the fish at his or her cubicle. That person would be labeled the “King Phisher”

    In one organization I worked with, the initial reaction to the phishing program
    was less than ideal. In one extreme case, a woman who took all the wrong actions
    when receiving the phish was so angry, she demanded that I get on the phone, and
    she spent 10 minutes chewing me out. She told me what an awful person I am and
    how I need to reevaluate my life course. A few months later, the CEO of this massive
    organization held an all hands corporate meeting. In that meeting, the CEO mentioned
    the phishing program; he explained that he got phished like everyone else, and
    he was learning that he needed to be more aware. As if some mystical talisman
    was waved over the population, anger ceased to exist, aggression toward my SE
    team was lessened drastically, and we saw a much larger percentage of compliance.
    Sometimes the population feels they are being singled out to be made to look dumb.
    This can cause an adversarial relationship, and getting the top management of
