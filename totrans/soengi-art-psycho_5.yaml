- en: In the beginning of 2010, Google made the headlines and revealed that Chinese
    hackers were able to breach a part of its system.  Google claimed that some of
    its services were breached and that the perpetrators wanted to obtain access to
    Chinese human rights activists through their Gmail accounts.  Apart from Google,
    these social engineers also targeted other prominent companies, including Symantec,
    Adobe Systems, and Yahoo.

    of scouting and targeting Google employees in order to obtain information.  They
    began by using the information of employees found in social networks and other
    places.  Once they got the necessary information, the social engineers sent messages
    to the employees that appeared legitimate and coming from a friend or contact. 
    Thinking that the message truly came from their friends, the employees clicked
    on the links embedded with malware, resulting to the installation of spyware on
    their computers.

    The social engineers took their time in gathering information and winning the
    confidence of the employees so that they could interact and elicit information.

    strategy, social engineers find it easier to gather information about their targets. 
    Apart from conveying their marketing tactics through social media, companies also
    expose their company structure, making the information needed by social engineers
    readily available.

    with the successful ploy of social engineers.

    in Iraq, was accused of providing classified information to the founder of Wikileaks,
    Julian Assange.

    by the U.S. Department of State and Department of Defense for transmitting classified
    information, Manning was able to obtain the material.

- en: Meanwhile, Adrian Lamo, a former hacker, reported Manning to the authorities,
    telling the officials that Manning downloaded the material from SIPRNet and saving
    it on CD-RWs.  Manning was allegedly successful in fooling his colleagues that
    he was merely listening to music instead of accessing and downloading classified
    information.

- en: Manning carried out his ploy by coming in with music on a CD-RW with a label,
    such as “Lady Gaga.”  He erased the music, overwriting it with a compressed split
    file.  Manning told Lamo in an online chat that nobody from his colleagues suspected
    anything as he listened and even lip-synched Lady Gaga's song, Telephone.  While
    doing this, he “exfiltrated” probably the most magnanimous information spillage
    in the history of the United States.

    A social engineer like Manning is ruthless as he knew his action may result in
    a court martial, yet still pushed through with it.

    social engineers took advantage and sent out messages with a pickup line, “Do
    you want to read the file on Wikileaks?  Click here.”  Once users clicked on the
    link, it led them to a pdf file that allowed the social engineers to search the
    computer through a Javascript, determine the Adobe reader version on the computer,
    and launched their exploitation for such version.  The victims did not mind if
    the pdf took time to load as they were expecting a huge document.  However, they
    also did not know that it was not the document that took time to load, but the
    malware, which the social engineers embedded.

    for obtaining information are made available.  These tools are specifically designed
    for information gathering in social networking sites.

- en: In 2011, a tool referred to as a Facebook profile dumper was developed by a
    group of security researchers who were based in Egypt.  The tool was created to
    educate users on how people can get scammed easily on Facebook.  This Java-based
    tool was released for general use.  It automates the hidden Facebook profile data,
    which is collected from users and only accessible to friends in a network of a
    user.   According to the developers, the tool enables a user to send friend requests
    to a number of Facebook profiles.  The moment the recipient accepts the friend
    request, the tool dumps all his/her information, friend list, and photos to a
    local folder.

- en: The developers claimed that a scammer or social engineer collects information
    from the Facebook profile of a user simply by creating a new account.  The social
    engineer then adds all the user's friends through a “friending plugin” to ensure
    they share some common friends with the user.

    of the user's friends.  The plugin clones the display name and picture of the
    chosen friend and lays it to the authenticated account.

    the latter accepts it, the tool begins to save all information, tags, images,
    and accessible HTML pages, allowing the attacker to examine them offline.  While
    it may be too late, the user may unfriend the forged account in the event that
    he or she discovers that it is actually fake.

- en: Given that the social engineer was able to penetrate into the user's information,
    they will be able to carry out a number of social engineering ploys.  When social
    engineers are able to obtain more personal information, they are likely to carry
    out more convincing ploys.  For instance, a target is likely inclined to open
    a malicious email attachment, which social engineers normally use in a spear-phishing
    attempt, if it seems to appear authentic.

- en: The main goal of the tool's developers for releasing it is user awareness for
    what is transpiring in the world, specifically in social networks.  The developers
    claimed that the tool will provide people awareness and be cautious of the actions
    they make online.  For instance, accepting friend requests without verifying the
    authenticity of the profile is one of the wrong actions people make.  Social engineers
    will be able to exploit user profiles even with the shortest period given.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The developers also hope that they can make people aware of the flawed user
    verification process of Facebook.  They claim that it is advisable for Facebook
    to have stricter policies when it comes to verifying profiles who claim to be
    “friends” as well as filter out impersonating or fake accounts.
