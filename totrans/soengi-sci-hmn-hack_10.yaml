    hires a professional to try to penetrate the company's network. The end goal is
    that a pentest should help expose and patch any problems before malicious attackers
    can use them.
  prefs: []

    boards require companies to conduct pentests at least annually. As of right now,
    there are not many government compliance laws that require companies to include
    social engineering in these tests.
  prefs: []

    of it this way: When your kids clean the kitchen because they want to surprise
    you, they do a better job than when they are forced to do it as a chore.'

    backbone of `[www.social-engineer.org](http://www.social-engineer.org)`. It's
    called “The SE Framework,” and many organizations around the globe use it as a
    standard when planning out services for their annual SE engagements. However,
    there is still not a clear set of standards for SE pentesting. I think that's
    mainly because social engineering is so dynamic, it's nearly impossible to plan
    each stage.

    combine those vectors? You can answer all these questions as you start to plan

    back to a site to report that the phishing message was clicked. The stats are
    used to help a client see how susceptible people are to the attack vector of phishing
    and where education might be needed.

    a potent weapon.

    phone if you want to succeed. Learn to embrace it, even if it is not your favorite

    makes you more successful.  ## SMiShing'

    like what you see in [Figure 9-2](#c09-fig-0002). Most SMiShing messages are simple,
    but they're effective and generally geared toward loading malware on the mobile

    in mobile device breaches as well. Mobile breaches, which do things like reading

    hidden in a clipboard. I slipped into a server closet as I was trying to evade
    security, and I stumbled upon two people engaged in … well … not something you
    would think they would be doing at work. (Yes, sex, if you didn't guess it yet.)
    Stumbling on that made me forget I was supposed to be an SE for a second. The
    couple in the closet got mad and yelled at me, and I ran out. Later, I realized
    that I had almost 60 seconds of a sex tape filmed thanks to their lack of professionalism.

    about how I wanted to handle this.
