    especially if both infrastructure penetration testing and social engineering assessments
    by engaging an external professional testing company are already being carried
    out. The point could be argued that if an external company performed very regular
    testing than it would negate the need to run regular internal assessments utilizing
    internal staff. However, it is normally found that external companies are usually
    contracted to perform annual tests, especially where there is a compliance requirement
    to be tested on an annual basis. External assessments can be very expensive as
    they are labor intensive using highly skilled consultants and usually look at
    the whole infrastructure that is either in scope through need or a compliance
    requirement.

  zh: 一个经常被问到的问题是为什么需要进行内部测试，尤其是如果已经通过与外部专业测试公司进行基础设施渗透测试和社会工程评估。可以争论的一点是，如果外部公司定期进行测试，那么就不需要通过内部员工进行定期内部评估。然而，通常发现外部公司通常被合同要求每年进行测试，特别是在需要每年进行测试的合规要求下。外部评估可能非常昂贵，因为它们需要劳动密集型的高技能顾问，并且通常会审视整个基础设施，无论是出于需求还是合规要求。

- en: The security posture of a company is only assumed unless it is regularly tested.
    It is quite common to hear an IT manager to claim that they have anti-virus and
    they regularly patch so they have a secure network. This is a common statement
    from customer before a professional services engagement only to prove during the
    assessment that the network has many security vulnerabilities that the companies
    veiled security processes and procedures did not address. This can shock the client
    into how easy it is to go after a single entry point and then take complete ownership
    of the infrastructure from this single point once on the inside. Internal testing
    provides a means and way of testing this on a regular basis and can be very targeted.
    Try picking one area, e.g., user passwords and then design and perform an assessment
    of the user passwords which is covered later in this chapter. This constant measurement
    provides feedback to the business about the true security posture and can be used
    to leverage budgeting resource to contract an external company to provide either
    further security awareness training or more in-depth security testing to fully
    investigate the problems within the business.

  zh: 公司的安全姿态只有在定期测试之后才能确保。经常听到 IT 管理员声称他们有反病毒软件，并且定期打补丁，所以他们的网络是安全的，这是在专业服务开始前客户常说的一句话，然而在评估中却发现网络存在许多安全漏洞，这些公司遮掩的安全流程和程序没有解决。这会让客户震惊地意识到，攻击一个单一入口有多容易，并且一旦在内部就可以完全控制基础架构。内部测试提供了定期测试的方式和方法，并且可以非常有针对性。试着选择一个领域，例如用户密码，然后设计并执行用户密码的评估，这在本章后面有所涉及。这种持续的测量为企业提供了关于真实安全姿态的反馈，并且可以用来调动预算资源，与外部公司签订合同，提供进一步的安全意识培训或更深入的安全测试，以彻底调查业务中的问题。
- en: If security awareness training has already been provided or some other intervention
    aimed at improving the security posture of the business, then running an internal
    test is a great tool to benchmark the progress. Obviously, the first time any
    internal assessments are performed the baseline is set and then future assessments
    can provide a way of measuring the improvement or regression in the security posture.
    These assessments have to be carefully designed to take account of new employees
    within roles or new policies and procedures that could skew the results of the
    assessment. Again, this is a great way to hopefully justify that the investment
    into improving the security posture of the business has had a positive effect.

  zh: 如果已经提供了安全意识培训或其他旨在提高业务安全姿态的干预措施，那么进行内部测试是评估进展的重要工具。显然，第一次执行任何内部评估时，将设定基线，然后未来的评估可以提供一种衡量安全姿态改善或退化的方式。这些评估必须经过精心设计，以考虑到新员工在角色内的情况或可能影响评估结果的新政策和程序。同样，这是一种希望证明改善业务安全姿态的投资产生了积极效果的好方法。
- en: It is quite common for internal IT employees to wear multiple hats and in the
    current financial economy it appears that cutbacks have affected the staffing
    levels of various IT departments leaving employees performing multiple roles within
    the IT department. I hope we can agree that the security of the infrastructure
    is a key role and one that cannot just be outsourced to an external consultancy.
    In light of this, it is important to invest in the skills of the internal IT team
    with regard to security. It is not assumed that the internal team would gain the
    specialist knowledge or experience to become fully fledged penetration testers,
    able to perform assessments on third-party networks but it is hoped that the level
    of investment into training the team would be adequate to allow them to understand
    the concepts and to design and implement effective internal assessments against
    their own network and users in order to highlight required improvements to their
    internal security posture. As well as providing valuable skills to the employees
    that can be leveraged by the business, this form of up-to-date training also helps
    with employee engagement as they will feel more current and there are many positive
    links between engaged employees and company productivity.

  zh: 内部IT员工穿多顶帽子是相当普遍的，在当前的金融经济形势下，裁员似乎影响了各个IT部门的人员配备，导致员工在IT部门内承担多个角色。希望我们能够一致认为基础设施的安全是一个关键角色，而且不能简单地外包给外部咨询公司。鉴于此，重要的是要投资于内部IT团队的安全技能。并不是假设内部团队会获得专业知识或经验成为完全成熟的渗透测试人员，能够对第三方网络进行评估，但希望对团队进行的培训投资水平足够，使他们能够理解概念，并设计和实施有效的内部评估，以突出内部安全姿态的必要改进。除了为员工提供有价值的技能，可以为企业提供支持，这种最新的培训还有助于员工参与度，因为他们会感觉更加现代化，员工参与度与公司生产力之间存在许多积极联系。
- en: There is also the psychological effect on the employees when they know that
    they are being tested. People tend to display different behaviors when they know
    that they may be found out and made an example of in front of their peers. It
    is plausible to hypothesize that employees who are aware that internal tests are
    carried out are less likely to undergo unsafe activities and to generally work
    in a more secure manner. One simple behavior of asking users to lock their workstation,
    when leaving their workspace, can be enforced by catching people out who have
    left their workstations unlocked and, therefore, generating a sense of security
    paranoia where an employee will leave their workplace and then return as they
    recognized that they had not locked their workstations.

  zh: 当员工知道自己正在接受测试时，对员工的心理影响也是存在的。人们在知道可能被发现并在同事面前被作为榜样时，往往会展现出不同的行为。可以假设，意识到内部测试正在进行的员工更不太可能从事不安全的活动，通常会以更安全的方式工作。一个简单的行为，比如要求用户在离开工作区时锁定他们的工作站，可以通过抓住那些忘记锁定工作站的人来强制执行，从而产生一种安全恐慌感，员工会离开工作场所然后返回，因为他们意识到自己没有锁定工作站。
- en: One example of this could be the personal bag spot checks that are employed

- en: A configuration vulnerability is related to the way a piece of software is configured,
    or more appropriately, misconfigured. Various software applications require configuration.
    It is hoped that software vendors today issue software with a default secure configuration
    but this has not always been the case with many historical providers releasing
    software that is insecure, relying on the user to secure it. This can be referred
    to an open or closed configuration. It is preferred to start with a closed configuration
    and open that parts needed. However, the easiest solution is to start with an
    open configuration and close the parts that are not needed but far too often these
    parts never get closed and this then leads to a configuration vulnerability which
    will always be exploited by a serious penetration tester or worse, a potential
    attacker. An example of a configuration vulnerability may be a network device,
    such as router or switch, with the insecure connection method of Telnet enabled
    rather than the secure method of SSH. This may also be further compounded if no
    password is required in order to gain access to the device. Both of these are
    configuration vulnerabilities that can be remedied through correct configuration
    of the device.

  zh: 配置漏洞与软件配置方式有关，或者更恰当地说是配置错误。各种软件应用都需要配置。希望今天的软件供应商发布具有默认安全配置的软件，但是历史上许多供应商发布的软件并非如此，而是不安全的，依赖用户来保护它。这可以称为开放或封闭配置。最好从封闭配置开始，然后打开需要的部分。然而，最简单的解决方案是从开放配置开始，关闭不需要的部分，但是很多时候这些部分从未关闭，这就导致了配置漏洞，这将始终被严肃的渗透测试人员或更糟的是潜在的攻击者利用。配置漏洞的一个例子可能是网络设备，如路由器或交换机，使用了不安全的Telnet连接方法，而不是安全的SSH方法。如果不需要密码即可访问设备，则可能会进一步加重这种情况。这两者都是通过正确配置设备可以纠正的配置漏洞。
- en: Vulnerability scanning can be used in an internal test to check for both software
    and configuration vulnerabilities. This can be beneficial to confirm the patch
    levels of the servers, which are very useful in Windows environments to ensure
    that all of the critical security patches have been applied. This type of scanning
    can also be useful to look for any configuration errors that may exist on devices
    within your organization. Keeping up with the results found on a vulnerability
    scan and ensuring that any hosts have no high-level vulnerabilities is a great
    way to increase the security posture and greatly reduce the ability for a potential
    attacker to gain access to any corporate resources.

- en: Various passwords are used for authentication to numerous services in the modern
    digital life both at work and at home. One very good test to perform internally
    is the strength of users password for core services within the organization. The
    authors of this book regularly perform infrastructure assessments where the network
    and servers yield no exploitable vulnerabilities but then a weak user or administrative
    password allows them to access the network where they can then escalate their
    privileges leading to an eventual takeover of the infrastructure. Passwords still
    appear to be the weak link in the security posture of most organizations with
    the age long problem of either having a password that is so complex that it is
    difficult to remember or a password that is memorable but that is far too weak.

  zh: 在现代数字生活中，无论在工作还是家庭中，都需要对多种服务进行身份验证。一个非常好的内部测试是对组织内核心服务的用户密码强度进行测试。本书的作者定期执行基础设施评估，其中网络和服务器没有可利用的漏洞，但是一个弱用户或管理员密码允许他们访问网络，然后他们可以提升其权限，最终接管基础设施。密码似乎仍然是大多数组织安全姿态的软肋，存在长期以来的问题，即要么密码太复杂以至于难以记忆，要么密码易于记忆但过于简单。
- en: It is assumed that as part of the policy strengthening, a policy of secure passwords
    has been implemented and the associated controls are in place to ensure that strong
    passwords of adequate length and complexity are enforced by all core services
    within the infrastructure, along with two factor authentication where a higher
    level of authentication is required. This has to also be enforced for service
    and administrative accounts for all hosts on the network. The authors have seen
    very complex password policies enforced in organizations for their users only
    to find very weak passwords on service accounts and network devices that are not
    linked to the password policy. It is almost like some IT teams having a rule for
    the users and a separate rule for themselves, and it is rather embarrassing when
    it is identified that the weak password exploited on a test belonged to a service
    account or the member of the IT team.

    how the assessment can be developed and covered the testing of the internal infrastructure,
    as well as the people and processes within the organization. Vulnerability scanning
    and password auditing were identified and outlined as two methods that could be
    used before looking at the people and processes and covering the three attack
    vectors covered by the majority of this book: the email attack vector, the telephone
