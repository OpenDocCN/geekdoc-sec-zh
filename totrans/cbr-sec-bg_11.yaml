- en: As a very large company, highly reliant on technology, Sony had frequently been
    the target of cyber attacks in the past.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To provide flexibility for their diverse divisions, Sony operated a flexible
    approach to the security of their systems, allowing each group of companies to
    implement and manage what each required, at the same time as having some overall
    security systems that operated across all divisions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This approach has the advantage of allowing different divisions to incorporate
    new technologies to help expand and deliver products to fulfill customer needs
    and in turn to increase revenues.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This strategy can work well, but entails much higher operating costs than top-down
    security enforcement does.  When running security separately for each division,
    it is vital to understand what the responsibilities and boundaries are for each
    section.  Adequate funding must be in place, and it must be sufficient to allow
    each division to manage a comprehensive approach to security, including all the
    components we have explored in this book.

    received a communication from a group calling itself ‘God’sApstls,’ demanding
    monetary compensation to prevent Sony from ‘being bombarded as a whole.’  The
    recipients reportedly ignored or treated this communication as spam.

    Sony Corporation, discovered that a significant number of their systems had been
    compromised. A substantial amount of data had already been taken, and a number
    of critical services were rendered inoperable.  The exact causes and infiltration
    points were unknown at this point.

- en: The first reports of the attack being detected surfaced when employee computer
    screens at Sony Pictures Entertainment headquarters in Culver City, California,
    began flashing with a message from the hackers.  The message included links to
    some of the stolen data the hackers had collected.  At this time the attackers
    identified themselves as the ‘Guardians of Peace.’

    Some of the stolen data had been posted online, and the media began to examine
    the contents.

    had a significant impact on Sony’s immediate operations.  Indeed, Sony employees
    around the world allegedly continued to work without being able to use their computers,
    email or voicemail for many days.

    several pages. The attackers (the Guardians of Peace) initially (that same month)
    revealed that they had managed to take over 12 terabytes of information.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Indications are that the malware the hackers used continued working for some
    time, even after the attack was detected.  Final assessments put the amount of
    data the hackers removed at over 100 terabytes.  To put that figure in perspective,
    the entire US Library of Congress in digital format is just 10% of that size.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This ongoing exfiltration of information indicated that the malware was polymorphic
    (as outlined in the previous chapter), and, at the time, could not be blocked
    or quarantined with existing anti-malware.  So even though Sony’s security team
    attempted to quarantine or remove the stolen data, these attempts were unsuccessful.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Other security measures that were in place, such as firewalls that should have
    closed down the system in an emergency, also failed to immediately block or prevent
    the ongoing outflow of information.  This indicated that the malware was bypassing
    these defenses as well as evading the anti-malware software.

    (relatively insignificant) data frequently existing alongside small pockets of
    highly sensitive information.

    of a film called The Interview, which reportedly offended the North Korean government.

    this malware as a worm.

    block, or SMB.  Because the worm could also delete information, it was also referred
    to as a ‘wiper.’  This approach had been used in other attacks, and a number of
    patches were available that could have helped address this vulnerability.

    on informing a company’s executives about the extent of the risks and ensuring
    that a holistic understanding of the level of exposure exists.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Based on the extent of the infiltration and the resulting damage, it is evident
    that a key root cause was the large number of gaps in the defense layers.  Overall,
    the amount of data that was taken indicates that data loss prevention tools at
    network and device levels were either bypassed or absent; either way, these tools
    proved to be ineffective.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Although it was (at that time) nearly impossible to fully protect a system against
    an attack that uses polymorphic malware, the malware itself mostly leverages known
    exploits for which protective measures already existed.  This means that although
    an attack using polymorphic malware can create damage, the scale and impact can
    be substantially reduced when all other security measures are operating effectively.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As we covered in the last chapter, putting hardened, defense in depth in place
    is expensive, and so is regularly updating cyber defenses based on evolving methods
    of attack.  But this type of breach reveals the fact that not investing in holistic,
    frequently-updated defenses can end up costing more than strong, adaptable defense
    in depth does.

    actually instigated by North Korea, a few key facts indicate this to be the case.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The type of software used to infiltrate Sony, though modified to help it evade
    anti-malware, was very similar to that used in an earlier attack made on South
    Korea in March 2013.  That attack was also attributed to North Korea.

    Thailand.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Analysts also found evidence that the malware may have been present and remained
    undetected within Sony’s systems for some time prior to the date that the attack
    was revealed.  This evidence supported the observation that it would have been
    very difficult to collect and steal the amount of data that was involved in a
    time span of less than several months.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The malware used exploits (specific techniques) that were known for some time,
    and had Sony installed patches (updates) that were available from software manufacturers,
    their systems would have resisted the ‘known’ exploits.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once the attack was known to be in progress, it appeared that the company was
    unable to rapidly update their intrusion detection and prevention routines to
    block the attack.  This provides further support for the argument that the failure
    to routinely install updates played a big role in increasing Sony’s vulnerability
    to an attack of this magnitude.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Analysts also found that Sony’s record retention and destruction procedures,
    at least for email systems, were either nonexistent or highly deficient.  Automatically
    removing and destroying email after a specific, limited time period, unless it
    was explicitly earmarked for retention, would have substantially reduced the impact
    of the data exposure.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In other words, the size and sensitivity of the attack surface was larger and
    more vulnerable than it needed to be because of deficiencies in patch management
    and records retention and destruction policies.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Additionally, the attackers were able to locate some sensitive data alongside
    non-sensitive data.  This indicated that information classification processes
    were not fully in place.  Sensitive information was not consistently separated
    and subject to higher security measures than non-sensitive data was.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There has been unsubstantiated speculation that another root cause of the attack
    involved disaffected former employees leveraging inside information.  Part of
    the rationale for this accusation is that the extent of the damage and infiltration
    could be more rationally explained if the attackers had a reasonable understanding
    of Sony systems, network locations and vulnerability points to assist them in
    planning their attack strategy.

    security is single point accountability.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '| single point (of) accountability (SPA or SPOA) – the principle that all critical
    assets, processes and actions must have clear ownership and traceability to a
    single person.  The rationale is that the absence of a defined, single owner is
    a frequent cause of process or asset protection failure.  Shared ownership is
    regarded as a significant security gap due to the consistent demonstration that
    security flaws have an increased probability of persisting when more than one
    person is accountable. |'

  type: TYPE_TB
- en: At the beginning of this book I presented the statement, ‘Nobody ever made a
    statue to honor a committee.  Operating a divisional approach to security can
    work, but requires clear and accountable lines of single point accountability
    to be defined.  If everyone is responsible, often nobody is accountable.  Who
    was the person ultimately responsible for Sony’s security?  Was it the executive
    at the division level, or the executive at the corporate level?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These types of poorly-defined accountability policies lead to slow and inadequate
    responses in the face of agile and fast-moving attackers.  Each organization must
    adopt a security posture that reflects the value of its information and the types
    of attackers they are likely to encounter.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In summary, Sony did not have the scale of defense-in-depth security controls
    in place to manage the threat that materialized.  They did not sufficiently anticipate
    or prepare for an attack that could potentially impact them on this scale.
