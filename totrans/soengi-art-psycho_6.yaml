    are resistant to the threat of social engineering.  On the contrary, no organization
    is immune to social engineering, not even the White House or any other prominent

    were asked to obtain information from target companies, which could be utilized
    for a hypothetical attack.  Out of the 140 phone calls that were made to employees
    of the target companies, almost all the employees divulged information except
    for five, who refused to give out anything.  In addition, 90% of the employees
    clicked on a URL, which was sent to them by the participants.  These employees
    did not even bother knowing the person who sent it.  This security conference
    concluded on how wide and dangerous the scope of social engineering is for all
    systems and organizations.

- en: Before any organization can prevent and mitigate social engineering, the first
    step is to learn how to determine whether or not an attack is a part of a social
    engineering ploy.  Organizations do not need to know how to create the perfect
    con or plot a malicious attack.  The key is to understand what transpires the
    moment a malicious PDF link is clicked as well as the signs to look for when identifying
    if an individual is into something deceptive.  Organizations need to understand
    the threat of social engineering and how such threat applies to them.

    values both his house and family; thus, he would want to protect them all the
    time from any harm or malicious acts.  In order to do this, Mr. Z should not wait
    for a fire in his home to know how to prevent and mitigate the danger.  What he
    should do is plan an escape path and install smoke detectors in case of a fire. 
    Furthermore, Mr. Z should make his family members aware of the phrase, “stop,
    drop, and roll” so they would know what to do in case of fire.  Teaching his family
    how to get to the door and avoid the smoke by staying low can mitigate the dangers
    of a fire.  Mr. Z can apply all these methods in order to prevent and mitigate
    a fire.

    security.  They should be armed with techniques for securing not only company
    information, but personal information as well.  Organizations can provide their
    staff with security seminars to obtain tips on what needs to be locked up or shredded
    at home, how to secure home-based wireless networks, and how to manage personal
    passwords among others.

    their staff.  For instance, posters can be put up at coffee rooms, smoking areas,
    fax machines, and even shred bins.  The posters should be eye-catching so the
    staff would not miss out on it.  In addition, the posters should be visible enough
    so that any employ who walks by can read and understand them clearly.  The message
    should be changed at least once a month so that the staff has something new to
    learn about security.  If an organization does not have an internal graphic artist,
    it can use security awareness vendors to avail ready-made posters.

    many organizations have conceptualized a campaign with the message, “Stop, Think,
    Connect”, which aims to encourage people to think first before engaging in a potentially
    dangerous or destructive activity online.  This message is proposed to be understood
    as well as carried out as easily as other widely-known slogans, such as “Stop,

    employee.  More often than not, companies who undergo a social engineering audit
    think that terminating the employee or employees who fell for the ploy is the
    solution to the problem and fixes the hole.  However, companies should realize
    that once an audit is done, the employees who fell for the attack are probably
    the most secure employees in the building during that time.  Consequently, a professional
    security auditor should also take actions in ensuring that the jobs of employees
    would not be jeopardized.
