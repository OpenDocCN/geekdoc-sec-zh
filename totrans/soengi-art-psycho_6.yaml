    were asked to obtain information from target companies, which could be utilized
    for a hypothetical attack.  Out of the 140 phone calls that were made to employees
    of the target companies, almost all the employees divulged information except
    for five, who refused to give out anything.  In addition, 90% of the employees
    clicked on a URL, which was sent to them by the participants.  These employees
    did not even bother knowing the person who sent it.  This security conference
    concluded on how wide and dangerous the scope of social engineering is for all
    systems and organizations.

    step is to learn how to determine whether or not an attack is a part of a social
    engineering ploy.  Organizations do not need to know how to create the perfect
    con or plot a malicious attack.  The key is to understand what transpires the
    moment a malicious PDF link is clicked as well as the signs to look for when identifying
    if an individual is into something deceptive.  Organizations need to understand
    the threat of social engineering and how such threat applies to them.

  zh: 在任何组织可以预防和减轻社会工程之前，第一步是学会如何确定攻击是否是社会工程策划的一部分。 组织不需要知道如何创建完美的欺骗或策划恶意攻击。 关键是要理解当恶意的
    PDF 链接被点击时会发生什么，以及在确定某个个人是否涉及欺骗性行为时要寻找的迹象。 组织需要了解社会工程的威胁以及这种威胁如何适用于它们。
- en: Take for example, Mr. Z, who owns a house and lives with his family.  Mr. Z
    values both his house and family; thus, he would want to protect them all the
    time from any harm or malicious acts.  In order to do this, Mr. Z should not wait
    for a fire in his home to know how to prevent and mitigate the danger.  What he
    should do is plan an escape path and install smoke detectors in case of a fire. 
    Furthermore, Mr. Z should make his family members aware of the phrase, “stop,
    drop, and roll” so they would know what to do in case of fire.  Teaching his family
    how to get to the door and avoid the smoke by staying low can mitigate the dangers
    of a fire.  Mr. Z can apply all these methods in order to prevent and mitigate
    a fire.

    他应该做的是规划一个逃生路径，并安装烟雾探测器以防火灾发生。 此外，Z 先生应该让家人了解“停下、滚动、和滚动”的口诀，这样他们在火灾发生时就知道该怎么做。
    教会家人如何走到门口并低头避开烟雾可以减轻火灾的危险。 Z 先生可以应用所有这些方法来预防和减轻火灾。
