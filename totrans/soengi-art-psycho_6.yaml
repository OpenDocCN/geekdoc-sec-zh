    were asked to obtain information from target companies, which could be utilized
    for a hypothetical attack.  Out of the 140 phone calls that were made to employees
    of the target companies, almost all the employees divulged information except
    for five, who refused to give out anything.  In addition, 90% of the employees
    clicked on a URL, which was sent to them by the participants.  These employees
    did not even bother knowing the person who sent it.  This security conference
    concluded on how wide and dangerous the scope of social engineering is for all
    systems and organizations.

    step is to learn how to determine whether or not an attack is a part of a social
    engineering ploy.  Organizations do not need to know how to create the perfect
    con or plot a malicious attack.  The key is to understand what transpires the
    moment a malicious PDF link is clicked as well as the signs to look for when identifying
    if an individual is into something deceptive.  Organizations need to understand
    the threat of social engineering and how such threat applies to them.

    values both his house and family; thus, he would want to protect them all the
    time from any harm or malicious acts.  In order to do this, Mr. Z should not wait
    for a fire in his home to know how to prevent and mitigate the danger.  What he
    should do is plan an escape path and install smoke detectors in case of a fire. 
    Furthermore, Mr. Z should make his family members aware of the phrase, “stop,
    drop, and roll” so they would know what to do in case of fire.  Teaching his family
    how to get to the door and avoid the smoke by staying low can mitigate the dangers
    of a fire.  Mr. Z can apply all these methods in order to prevent and mitigate
    a fire.
