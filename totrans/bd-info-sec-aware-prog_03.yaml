- en: Apart from the efforts of myself, the success of this book depends largely on
    the encouragement and support of many others. Thank you to my husband Chad and
    children Andrew and Lily for their patience and support during the many hours
    glued to my keyboard. I promise to take a break now. A special thanks to my parents
    who saved the little storybooks that I wrote at the age of 7; hopefully, this
    is more impressive. I would like to thank Syngress and my coauthor Bill Gardner
    for making this publication possible. Thanks to Tim Lawton, Jay Llewellyn, and
    Danielle Dominguez for helping me in the content review and editing process. Thank
    you to my friend, Kevin Mitnick, for writing the foreword for this book. It's
    been many years since I first opened The Art of Deception, which inspired my career
    in information security, and I can't thank you enough for your inspiration and
    support. I would also like to thank Dave Kennedy for also contributing a foreword
    to this book and for being an inspiration to all of us in the security industry.
    Thanks to my friend and mentor Chris Russo, who always helped me find my way.
