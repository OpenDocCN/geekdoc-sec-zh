    engineering.  I hope it has helped you in maintaining or establishing a healthy
    dose of fear for the potential destruction that social engineering can bring,
    not only to companies or organizations, but also in your home and personal life. 
    Thus, I hope you will continue to pay attention to possible malicious attacks
    as discussed in this book.
