    or exit from a physical, virtual or digital area through the use of permissions. 
    Permissions are usually assigned individually to a person, device or application
    service to ensure accountability and traceability of usage.  The permissions can
    be secured using (i) physical tokens (something you have); for example a key card,
    (ii) secret information (something you know); such as a password or (iii) biometric
    information – using part of the human body such as a fingerprint or eye scan to
    gain access (something you are).  See also multi-factor authentication.

- en: Advanced Persistent Threats  (APTs) – a term used to describe the tenacious
    and highly evolved set of tactics used by hackers to infiltrate networks through
    digital devices and to then leave malicious software in place for as long as possible. 
    The cyber attack lifecycle usually involves the attacker performing research &
    reconnaissance, preparing the most effective attack tools, getting an initial
    foothold into the network or the target digital landscape, spreading the infection
    and adjusting the range of attack tools in place to then exploit the position
    to maximum advantage.  The purpose can be to steal or corrupt an organization’s
    digital data or to extort money from the organization and/or disrupt its operations,
    for financial gain, brand damage or other political purposes.  This form of sophisticated
    attack becomes harder and more costly to resolve the further into the lifecycle
    the attackers are and the longer they have managed to already leave the malicious
    software in place.  A goal with this threat type is for the intruder to remain
    (persist) undetected for as long as possible in order to maximize the opportunities
    presented by the intrusion – for example, to steal data over a long period of
    time.  See also kill-chain.

- en: anti-malware – is a computer program designed to look for specific files and
    behaviors (signatures) that indicate the presence or the attempted installation
    of malicious software.  If or when detected, the program seeks to isolate the
    attack (quarantine or block the malware), remove it, if it can, and also alert
    appropriate people to the attempt or to the presence of the malware.  The program
    can be host-based (installed on devices that are directly used by people) or network-based
    (installed on gateway devices through which information is passed).  Older forms
    of this software could detect only specific, pre-defined forms of malicious software
    using signature files.  Newer forms use machine learning and make use of additional
    techniques including behavior monitoring.

- en: anti-virus –  predecessor of anti-malware software that was used before the
    nature and types of malicious software had diversified.  This is a computer program
    designed to look for the presence or installation of specific files.  If or when
    detected, the program seeks to isolate the attack (quarantine or block the virus),
    remove it, if it can, and also alert appropriate people to the attempt.  A virus
    is only one form of malware, so the term anti-malware is considered to be more
    inclusive of other forms of malicious software.  However, as people are more familiar
    with the term ‘anti-virus,’ this can sometimes be used to describe various types
    of anti-malware.  See also anti-malware and virus.

- en: application – a collection of functions and instructions in electronic format
    (a software program) that resides across one or more digital devices, usually
    designed to create, modify, process, store, inspect and/or transmit specific types
    of data.  For subversive applications, see malware.

- en: assessments – the evaluation of a target (for example an application, service,
    or supplier) against specific goals, objectives or other criteria through the
    collection of information about it.  Usually, this is achieved through an established
    and repeatable process that involves discussing or answering questions about the
    target’s capabilities and approaches.  The purpose is to understand how closely
    the target meets the intended criteria and to identify any gaps or deficiencies. 
    An assessment is different than an audit because it does not necessarily check
    for evidence (proof) that the responses are genuine and does not need to be carried
    out by an objective third party. It can be considered that a security assessment
    is usually akin to a consultative audit that does not seek to catch out or disprove
    the evidence provided by the target being examined.

    a target product, service and/or location is meeting the specific required control
    standards.  This form of inspection requires that individual controls are tested
    to confirm their suitability and consistent usage.  The outcomes from this type
    of event, including any gaps discovered and corrective actions required, are always
    provided in a final report.

    onto a view of the real world.  The digital layer may seem to interact with the
    real world, but the impact is limited to affecting the perspective of the user
    (or users) who are immersed in the experience.  This differs from virtual reality,
    in which the immersed users can only perceive a fully artificial world.  Advanced
    versions of augmented reality that can map and understand objects and surfaces,
    and can then seem to allow digital projections to interact with real-world objects,
    are referred to as mixed reality.  See also metaverse and mixed reality.

- en: availability – the assignment of a value to a set of information to indicate
    how much disruption or outage the owner considers to be acceptable.  Often this
    is expressed or translated into a scale of time. Data with the highest possible
    availability  rating would be required to be readily accessible at all times (no
    downtime permitted), often through the use of a fully redundant failsafe.  The
    value assigned to the information’s availability is used by the owner of an application
    or service to set the recovery time objective.  See also integrity – a different,
    but related term.

- en: breach notification procedure – some types of information, when suspected or
    known to be lost or stolen, must, by law, be reported to one or more authorities
    within a defined time period.  Usually, this type of regulation applies to personal
    information.  The required notification time period varies, but is often within
    24 hours after the known or suspected breach takes place.  In addition to reporting
    the known or suspected loss to the authorities, the lead organization responsible
    for the information (referred to as the data controller) is also required to swiftly
    notify anyone who is affected, and later on, must submit (to appropriate regulators)
    a full root cause analysis and information about how the organization responded
    and fixed any issues that were identified.  To meet these legal obligations, larger
    companies usually have a pre-defined breach notification procedure to ensure that
    the timelines are met.  The fines for data breaches are usually increased or decreased
    based on the adequacy of the organization’s breach and incident response management.

- en: brute force (attack) – the use of a systematic approach that can quickly generate
    large volumes of possible methods to gain unauthorized access to a computer system. 
    For example, an automated script can run through the large but finite number of
    possibilities to try to guess a given eight-character password in a matter of
    seconds.  Computing speeds make brute force attempts to try millions of possibilities
    easy if other defenses are not present.  A common defense against this type of
    attack is to detect and block more than a few attempts at guessing any security
    information.

- en: cloud (the) – an umbrella term used to identify any technology service that
    uses software and equipment not physically managed or owned by the person or organization
    (customer) using it.  This usually provides the advantage of on-demand scalability
    at lower cost.  Examples include applications that are hosted online, online file
    storage areas, and even remote virtual computers.  Using a cloud means the equipment
    managing the service is run by the cloud provider and not by the customer.  But
    although the customer does not own the service, he or she is still accountable
    for the information that he or she chooses to store and process through it.  Usually
    a cloud service is identified by an ‘aaS’ suffix.  For example – SaaS (Software
    as a Service), IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) and PaaS (Platform as a Service).

    and (ii) the strategies used to help stop information from being taken out of
    an organization without the appropriate authorization.  Software technologies
    can use heuristics (patterns that fit within certain rules) to recognize, alert
    and/or block data extraction activities on digital devices.  For example, a DLP
    technology may prohibit specific types of file attachments from being sent out
    via Internet mail services.  These technologies can also prevent or monitor many
    other attempts at removing or copying data.  There are workarounds that can be
    used by skilled hackers to evade detection by these solutions, including encryption
    and fragmentation.  Although these solutions are becoming an essential line of
    defense, the most secure environments aim to prevent any significant set of data
    from being available for export in the first place.  For this reason, Data Loss
    Prevention is often thought of as the last line of defense (a final safety net
    if all other security controls have not been successful). Information Loss Prevention  (ILP)
    is an alternative version of the same term.

    example, data with the highest possible integrity rating could be given a value
    of ‘no data loss permitted.’  If it were permitted to lose up to 4 hours of data
    that had been processed, the value would be ‘4 hours.’  Usually, if any data loss

    frameworks, risk can be quantified using probability (often expressed as a percentage)
    and impact (often expressed as a financial amount).  Other parameters for risk

    threshold; for example, a minimum potential financial loss value that must be
    met or exceeded before an entry in the repository is required.  If a risk does
    occur, it technically becomes an issue (rather than a risk).  Items can continue
    to be tracked within a risk register until the impact has been successfully managed
    and the root cause(s) have been resolved to the extent that the risk is not likely
    to occur again.
