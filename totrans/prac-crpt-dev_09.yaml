- en: '**Symmetric key ciphers** (like **AES**, **ChaCha20**, **RC6**, **Twofish**,
    **CAST** and many others) use the same key (or password) to **encrypt** and **decrypt**
    data. They are often used in combination with other algorithms into a **symmetric
    encryption schemes** (like **ChaCha20-Poly1305** and **AES-128-GCM** and **AES-256-CTR-HMAC-SHA256**),
    often with password to **key derivation** algorithms (like **Scrypt** and **Argon2**).
    Symmetric key ciphers are **quantum-resistant**, which means that powerful quantum
    computers will not be able to break their security (when big enough key lengths
    are used). Symmetric ciphers can encrypt data coming as blocks of fixed size (**block
    ciphers**) or data coming as a sequence of bytes (**stream ciphers**). Block ciphers
    can be transformed to stream ciphers by certain constructions, known as "**block
    cipher modes** of operation".'

- en: '**Symmetric encryption** and decryption uses a **secret key** or passphrase
    (to derive the key from it). The **secret key** used to encrypt and decrypt the
    data is usually 128 bits or 256 bits and is called "**encryption key**". Sometimes
    it is given as hex or base64-encoded integer number or is derived through a **password-to-key
    derivation scheme**.'

    and when the ciphertext is decrypted, it is transformed back to the original input

    usually do not work standalone. They work together with other related crypto algorithms,
