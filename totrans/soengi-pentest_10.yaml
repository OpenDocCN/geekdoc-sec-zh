    scenarios to meet those objectives. This chapter provides a series of models that
    testers can use to create effective scenarios that not only meet objectives but
    also identify multiple vulnerabilities rather than concentrating on a single security
    flaw. The ultimate purpose of these models is to ensure that assessments provide
    value to the client and lead to improvements in their security.

    need to believe the caller to be the chief executive. Strictly speaking, pretexting

    the basis for the vast majority of social engineering scenarios it is usually

    should the threat agent be successful in exploiting a vulnerability, i.e. the
    damage caused should a social engineer successfully gain access to the employee’s
    email account and publish the contents online. It is important to clearly define
    the exposure and present it as the worst-case scenario. A successful attack and
    a defined exposure can at the very least provide a great deal of leverage when
    securing budget for improvements to security.

    The initial briefing will define clear rules of engagement, such as no lock picking,
    no damage to company property, no disruption to business activities and strictly
    no access to certain areas. However, rules at this stage mean that multiple scenarios
    can be designed with varying rules to identify different issues. For example,
    a client may decide that they would not like any lock-picking activities as it
    could damage the locks, which are expensive to replace. However, one or two scenarios
    could involve lock picking providing they are confined to certain areas of the
    building. The testers could then perform scenarios with and without lock picking
    and present the results to the client, which could be very surprising and valuable.
    Therefore, defining rules of engagement as a component of individual scenarios
    is important.
  id: totrans-54

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 在设计任何情景之前，这个组件通常会与客户讨论。初始简报将明确定义规则，如不锁拾、不损坏公司财产、不干扰业务活动和严格禁止进入某些区域等。然而，在这个阶段的规则意味着可以设计多个具有不同规则的情景来识别不同的问题。例如，客户可能决定不想进行任何锁拾活动，因为这可能会损坏锁，而更换锁的费用很昂贵。然而，一两个情景可能涉及锁拾，只要它们限制在建筑物的某些区域。然后，测试人员可以执行具有和不具有锁拾的情景，并将结果呈现给客户，这可能是非常令人惊讶和有价值的。因此，定义规则是各个情景的组成部分至关重要。

  zh: • **资源**
- en: Certain scenarios can be performed with a single engineer, others require more
    than one. In some cases multiple engineers can supplement scenarios in supporting
    roles, increasing the chances of success. Therefore, the resources available to
    perform the specific scenario are an important component to include. For example,
    there may be a single scenario with two variants, one with a single engineer and
    one with two engineers. The difference in the results between the two scenarios
    could be significant.

    scenario in one way or another. For example, if it was raining then the social
    engineer would look pretty odd lurking outside. If it is foggy then security cameras
    will be affected. If it is hot weather windows and doors may be left open. Therefore,
    it is important to include these details as part of the scenario as they may need
    to be repeated when environmental factors are not a complication.

  zh: 这些是组织无法控制的影响情景的因素。例如，如果下雨，社会工程师看起来会很奇怪在外面潜伏。如果雾天，安全摄像头将受到影响。如果天气炎热，窗户和门可能会被打开。因此，重要的是将这些细节作为情景的一部分包括进来，因为在没有环境因素干扰时可能需要重复。

    even switching between targets as they play out their complex scenarios. As professional
    security consultants, this kind of freestyle scenario execution is not always
    a viable option. This is not to say that consultants shouldn’t take advantage
    of opportunities should they present themselves during an assessment, it is just
    important to maintain a clear structure. Presenting convoluted and sporadic results
    to clients is rarely beneficial in the attempts to improve security. It is important
    to try and keep scenarios clear and consistent so they identify the issues they
    were designed to. Additionally, documentation of the process is crucial to help
    the client understand the issues identified and also as a reference should additional
    testing take place at a later date. Finally, for a company branching out into
    social engineering assessments, this formal approach can help to keep the whole
    process clear and manageable.

    and ask for a badge, or they could first send a fake authorization email to reception
    before arriving. Again, these are just two of many different techniques that could
    be listed here. Both of these approaches come with an element of risk, which are
    listed next to the technique. In the diagram, just impersonating is classed as
    a high risk whereas impersonating with an email authorization is classed as a
    medium risk. The reason for this is that an email provides credibility (even if
    it isn’t in line with the standard procedures) and so should be slightly less
    risky. There are no scales for the assignment of risk, it is purely qualitative
    and ultimately the decision of the consultant.

- en: The techniques and attack vectors used in a pretext will result in the identification
    of different vulnerabilities if the objective is successfully achieved. In our
    example, just impersonating will identify issues with reception specific awareness
    training and pass replacement procedures. However, if the other approach is taken,
    using an email authorization letter, it also identifies issues with email specific
    awareness training. At first it would appear that the second approach would be
    more beneficial, but it isn’t always as simple as that. If the second approach
    is taken, more vulnerabilities are indeed identified, but taking the first approach
    will mean the vulnerabilities are more significant (because the consultant didn’t
    need any additional credibility to obtain a pass, they just asked for it).

    of different vulnerabilities. The telephone attack vector would identify issues
    with telephone caller validation procedures, whereas the email attack vector would
    identify issues with email specific awareness and training material. In addition,

    see which vulnerabilities are identified with each pretext, we can select the
    pretexts that would identify a good cross-section of different vulnerabilities.

    could potentially shift to an alternative approach immediately. However, a new

    they are calling or sending the email. However, a cover story isn’t just necessary
    in case they get questioned by suspicious employees, it is also there to ensure
    that common and innocuous questions don’t end up raising suspicion.

    to site to perform PAT testing on an employee’s laptop. It seems simple enough,
    but what if an employee innocently asked where the consultant trained to do PAT
    testing? It doesn’t matter how much the consultant “believes” they are that character,
    they won’t be able to pick answers out of thin air, and they shouldn’t have to
    rely on being able to talk their way out of it. If they don’t have a quick answer
    to such a harmless and innocuous question they could be in trouble. [Chapter 3](CHP003.xhtml)
    covered the basics of impersonation and the kind of questions they should be asking
    regarding the character. However, it is also important to consider the kinds of
    questions people may ask just in casual conversation. Build up a background to
    the character and expand on the purpose for being there.

- en: Each scenario that is created is initially designed to succeed and highlight
    certain vulnerabilities. However, a “failed” scenario can potentially highlight
    additional security issues. For example, instead of using supporting techniques
    to avoid being challenged, a consultant may actually try and look suspicious to
    assess how employees challenge new faces (which identifies issues with awareness
    and training programs). One particular assessment performed by the authors demonstrates
    this quite clearly. The client had insisted, despite the best efforts to dissuade
    them, that access to the server room should be the main objective. The reconnaissance
    was conducted, appropriate scenarios to identify vulnerabilities were designed
    and the engineers arrived to execute those scenarios. What wasn’t known was that
    the client had informed all the employees that an assessment was going to be performed
    and on which day. Once the consultant had gained access to the building, suspicious
    employees immediately surrounded them. They challenged the consultant asking them
    who they were and why they were there. The consultant, although somewhat taken
    aback by the ambush, held their composure and explained they were visiting from
    another branch and showed their “fake” employee badge (luckily this was in line
    with the current scenario they were executing). On seeing the employee badge the
    interrogators immediately dropped their accusations explaining “*Oh thank god
    for that! Apparently, there’s going to be a “mystery shopper” type guy at some
    point today, so we’re all on our guard! The IT department is that way.*”. The
    consultant took full advantage of the situation by chatting at length with the
    employees about this “mystery shopper.” In this example the consultant did not
    originally intend to be challenged in this way, but being challenged identified
    a very serious issue with the awareness and training program, or lack thereof.

- en: Another similar example involved a failed challenge by a security guard. Two
    consultants were involved in a standard assessment. One of the scenarios had resulted
    in them obtaining a valid pass, but only one. Toward the end of the assessment,
    the consultants decided to try and use the pass to get both of them into the building
    at the same time. They were successful in gaining access but a security guard,
    via the security cameras, observed the “piggybacking” with the pass. The guard
    quickly intercepted the two consultants and asked to see their employee badges.
    One consultant showed the valid badge and other claimed to have forgotten his
    badge, hence using his colleague’s. The security guard escorted the employee without
    a badge back to the security room for further questions, then allowed the other
    consultant with the valid badge to continue on. Had this been a real attack, although
    one individual was caught, the other would have been free to continue their task.

- en: Including scenarios that are bound to fail are important, but they shouldn’t
    always be approached in such a black and white fashion. Sometimes, the best approach
    is to design a collection of scenarios, all with the same objective, but with
    varying degrees of sophistication. To explain this more clearly, consider an email
    phishing attack scenario. By designing the perfect email phishing attack right
    down to the finest detail, so that the recipient couldn’t possibly spot it as
    a fake, you would be very likely to succeed. However, what does this prove? Possibly
    presenting the client with a worst-case scenario “*Look what an attacker could
    potentially do!*”. The problem is that the client will seriously struggle to defend
    against an attack like that, so what has the assessment really achieved? Instead,
    suppose that the testing company inserts a few minor errors, such as spelling
    mistakes, a slightly different domain name or inconsistencies in the email signature.
    Now, there is the potential for staff to spot these and contact the IT help desk
    to report it. What does this then tell the client? Quite a lot. It tells them
    that their employees are looking for these issues and reporting them appropriately.
    If they don’t receive any calls, then they know where their awareness and training
    programs need improvement. If the attack was reduced to the basics, involving
    very simple phishing attacks, then a lack of calls from the employee would indicate
    some serious security issues! These varying degrees of attack can all be launched
    simultaneously, as the testing company knows whom they are sending them to and
    the client knows who rang up to report the issue. In addition, if the phishing
    email is harvesting credentials, then the testing company can see who fell for
    the attack.
