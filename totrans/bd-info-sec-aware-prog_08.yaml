    From the CEO to the mailroom, all users are at risk and can be targeted by social
    engineers in both technical and nontechnical attacks.

    for securing the data of the organization. This is true because the IT staff is
    responsible for setting up the servers, network, client computers, firewalls,
    and other security products located at the edge of the organization's network.
    They are also likely in charge of installing antivirus software and critical security
    patches to software and operating systems.

    than keeping an eye on data security issues. It's the nature of what they do.
    That's why most organizations rely on security solution hardware and software
    to keep an eye on data security.

    in a holistic, proactive approach. As a result, it often ends up at the bottom
    of the priority list.

    and technical skill. As a result, the IT team might not be completely up-to-date
    on what they need to do to secure the organization's data.

- en: It is important not to forget IT when planning and implementing a security awareness
    program. Help desks are regularly targeted by social engineers in password reset
    attacks. Unless you give your IT folks the same information and training in regard
    to security awareness, there might be gaps in their knowledge because assumptions
    are being made about their level of knowledge of nontechnical attacks such as
    social engineering, dumpster diving, and phishing.

    enough to have the budget for a security team, they can only guard against known
    threats. They cannot keep your users from opening attachments and opening links,
    but they can be an important part of delivering the security awareness message
    and reminding users of their responsibility to help protect the organizations
    data.

    It is the receptionist's job to greet visitors and to direct the visitor or the
    caller to the correct person to help the customer or visitor in a polite manner.
    Since the receptionist is likely the first person a visitor sees or the first
    person they talk to on the phone, the receptionist is the public face of the organization.
    The duty of the receptionist it to answer questions and to generally provide a
    good customer service experience. Anything else would reflect poorly on the organization.
    Social engineers will take advantage of this situation.

    through the firewall when they can just walk in to a company wearing a delivery

    walk out the back door with the company's backup tapes, a computer, or even the

    we have put them in that position. It is very important receptionists receive
    security awareness training so they understand the unique position they are in,
    know how to identify social engineering threats, and put in place physical security
    policies that help them keep your organization safe. These policies include items
    such as guest/visitor sign-in sheets, guest/visitor badge policies, and guest/visitor
    escort policies.

    attack against the organization's accounting department. On security assessments
    and penetration tests, it is shocking how little thought goes into securing the
    part of the organization whose mission is to handle money. It is not uncommon
    to find passwords, bank account log-in information, and wire transfer information
    kept in text documents, unencrypted and without password protection on the desktops
    of accounting employees. One successful spear phishing attempt would put the attacker
    in a position to empty the organization's bank accounts.

    the same, regardless of education level or user role, is a huge mistake. Highly
    educated professionals such as doctors, lawyers, accountants, and college professors
    can be the hardest groups to target for security awareness training because they
    feel their years of education have made them immune to social engineering tricks.
    Yet many of these professionals, especially lawyers, are being targeted because
    security programs and security awareness programs have been overlooked as a priority.

    to derail a $40 billion acquisition of the world's largest potash producer [[1](#bb0010)].
    In November 2013, a Pittsburgh man was sentenced for “recklessly damaging a computer
    and password trafficking” in a case that involved a law firm's computer system
    [[2](#bb0015)]. As late as 2012, the FBI has warned lawyers that their firms need
    to increase their security because they were being targeted [[3](#bb0020)].

    Many professional organizations are repositories of confidential information,
    thus becoming targets. In May 2014, the Justice Department issued a 31-count indictment
    of five Chinese military officers for breaking into the networks of six American
    corporations to steal intellectual property. The data were worth billions of dollars
    accounting to the indictments.

    of the People''s Liberation Army called Unit 61398 (where all of the indicted

    defense firms, and financial institutions. President Obama and a few Cabinet secretaries
    have raised the issue in several diplomatic forums. Each time, Chinese officials
    have denied the charges and challenged the Americans to produce some evidence.

    all employees of an organization. The mailroom staff, secretaries, and receptionist,
    for example, have very little concept of what industrial espionage or intellectual
    property is, let alone how to protect it. As a result, attackers will use this
    knowledge gap in the form of phishing, infected attachments, and other social
    engineering to exploit these users and then pivot their attacks to steal the data
    they are after. We have already made receptionist security guards; now we make
    mailroom staff, secretaries, and other support staff network defenders through
    an effective security awareness program.

    engineering attacks and scams on social media, the risk is more than just clicking
    links in e-mail and opening the wrong attachment. There is also the risk that
    the confidential and privileged information that might aid an attacker might be
    posted to social media. Many users pick passwords based on information such as
    their pet's name, their spouse's name, their birth date, or other information
    that an attacker can find on social media. Users can also unintentionally reveal
    operational details of the organization such as the location of branch offices
    or the type of antivirus software installed on the organization's computers. While
    most people think of the traditional sites for social networking such as Twitter
    and Facebook, there are literally hundreds of social networking sites that users
    might be using [[6](#bb0035),[7](#bb0040)]. In the case of LinkedIn, the service
    actually caters to business networking. Beyond data leakage, these sites can house
    malware. Since anyone can typically upload any code they want to these sites,
    social media sites have been the points of infections for zero days in the past
    [[8](#bb0045)]. With the prevalent use of social media in originations at all
    levels, informing users of the threats that exist on social media platforms and
    how to detect and avoid them is especially important.

    can be useful to point out the financial harm a data breach can cause an organization.
    The recent breach at Target shows how a company can suffer financially and how
    repercussions can extend to people losing their jobs [[9](#bb0050)]. No one wants
    to be involved in a resume-generating event. Target has experienced a large amount
    of financial pain that has been directly linked to the breach from low earnings
    to the cost of ongoing litigation related to the breach [[10](#bb0055),[11](#bb0060)].
    The Target breach is remarkable because it is the first clear-cut and well-publicized
    case of a retailer suffering large financial losses as a result of the credit
    card breach. During the TJX breach in 2007, the stock actually rose after initial
    losses, and the stock has continued to do well over time. TJX remains one of the
    largest breaches in history [[12](#bb0065),[13](#bb0070)].

    information the organization collects about them in order to pay them and provide
    them and their dependents with medical and other insurances. When risk is made
    personal, more people will take notice of the importance of securing the organization's
    data because it has now been explained how a breach could also affect their personal
    data. People check their bank accounts from work, shop from work, and have pictures
