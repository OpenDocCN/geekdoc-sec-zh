    features of a threat), all the attackers have to do to evade it is to customize
    the malware.  This can now be done very simply with no programming knowledge at
    all, using pre-packaged software programs that customize or adjust the malware
    to make its signature sufficiently different from those that anti-malware typically
    recognizes.  This prevents the attack from being detected immediately, since an
    updated defense will not be added to a signature based anti-malware program until
    after the new malware version is discovered, isolated, submitted to anti-malware
    experts, decrypted, and analyzed.  Depending on how exotic (unusual and rare)
    the customized malware is, creating a new defense against it may take months or
    years – and due to the sheer volume of new malware (estimated at over half a million
    new variants every day), it may not be feasible to update older forms of anti-malware
    quickly enough for them to provide a viable defense.

    software and poor security configurations, the success of the attack largely derived
    from the fact that they had chosen to leave years and years of email in place
    online.

    that add substantially more protection to the most sensitive data.  Just as policies
    may govern the configuration of a high-security site, it is possible to mandate
    whether a high-security zone should be a closed system, or whether all inbound
    and outbound traffic must be fully decrypted and inspected.

    executive (board-level) support for the correct investment into security.  This
    requires presenting the executive with a clear picture of the size and scale of
    the organization’s risk exposure.  This is covered in greater detail in Chapters
    12 & 13.
