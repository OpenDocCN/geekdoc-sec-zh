  zh: 前言
- en: '*Social engineering*—I can remember when searching for that term led you to
    videos on getting free burgers or dates with girls. Now it seems like it''s almost
    a household term. Just the other day I heard a friend of the family, who''s not
    in this industry at all, talking about an email scam. She said, “Well, that''s
    just a great example of social engineering!”'

  zh: '*社会工程*——我还记得搜索这个词时会看到如何免费获得汉堡或与女孩约会的视频。现在看起来它几乎成为一个家喻户晓的术语。就在前几天，我听到一个家庭朋友，她完全不在这个行业中，谈论一个电子邮件诈骗案。她说：“嗯，这只是社会工程的一个很好的例子！”'
- en: It threw me for a loop for a second, but here we are, eight years after my decision
    to start a company solely focused on social engineering, and now it's a full-blown
    industry and household term.

  zh: 这让我有点困惑了一会儿，但是现在，距离我决定创办一家专注于社会工程的公司已经过去了八年，现在它已经成为一个完全发展起来的行业和家喻户晓的术语。
- en: If you were to just start reading this book it would be easy to mistake my intentions.
    You might think I am fully okay with arming the bad guys or preparing them for
    nefarious acts. That cannot be further from the truth.

  zh: 如果你刚开始阅读这本书，很容易误解我的意图。你可能会认为我完全支持武装坏人或为他们准备不道德的行为。这与事实相去甚远。
- en: 'When I wrote my first book, there were many folks who, during interviews, got
    very upset with me and said I was arming the malicious social engineers. I felt
    the same then as I do now: you cannot really defend against social engineering
    until you know all sides of its use. Social engineering is a tool like a hammer,
    shovel, knife, or even a gun. Each has a purpose that can be used to build, save,
    feed, or survive; each tool also can be used to maim, kill, destroy, and ruin.
    For you to understand how to use social engineering to build, feed, survive, or
    save, you need to understand both uses. This is especially true if your goal is
    to defend. Defending yourself and others from malicious uses of social engineering
    requires that you step over into the dark side of it to get a clear picture of
    how it is used.'

  zh: 当我写我的第一本书时，有很多人在采访中对我感到非常不满，并说我在武装恶意的社会工程师。我当时的感觉和现在一样：在了解其使用的各个方面之前，你无法真正防御社会工程。社会工程就像锤子、铲子、刀子或甚至枪支一样是一种工具。每种工具都有可以用来建设、保存、喂养或生存的目的；每种工具也可以用来伤害、杀害、摧毁和毁灭。要想了解如何使用社会工程来建设、喂养、生存或保存，你需要了解两种用途。如果你的目标是防御，这一点尤为重要。保护自己和他人免受社会工程的恶意使用需要你跨越到其黑暗面，以清晰地了解其使用方式。
- en: I was recently chatting with AJ Cook about her work on *Criminal Minds*, and
    she mentioned that she often has to meet with real federal agents who work serial-killer
    cases to prepare herself for playing the role of JJ on the show. The same idea
    applies directly to this book.

  zh: 我最近与AJ Cook讨论了她在《犯罪心理》中的工作，她提到她经常不得不会见真正从事连环杀手案件的联邦特工，以便为在节目中扮演JJ的角色做好准备。这个想法直接适用于这本书。

    knowledge, experience, and practical wisdom I have learned over the last decade

- en: When I teach my five-day courses, I always ask the students to not treat me
    like some infallible instructor. If they have knowledge, thoughts, or even feelings
    that contradict something I say, I want to discuss it with them. I love learning
    and expanding my understanding on these topics. I extend the same request to you.
