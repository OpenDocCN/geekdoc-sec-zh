- en: '*Social engineering*—I can remember when searching for that term led you to
    videos on getting free burgers or dates with girls. Now it seems like it''s almost
    a household term. Just the other day I heard a friend of the family, who''s not
    in this industry at all, talking about an email scam. She said, “Well, that''s
    just a great example of social engineering!”'

    to start a company solely focused on social engineering, and now it's a full-blown
    industry and household term.

    You might think I am fully okay with arming the bad guys or preparing them for
    nefarious acts. That cannot be further from the truth.

- en: 'When I wrote my first book, there were many folks who, during interviews, got
    very upset with me and said I was arming the malicious social engineers. I felt
    the same then as I do now: you cannot really defend against social engineering
    until you know all sides of its use. Social engineering is a tool like a hammer,
    shovel, knife, or even a gun. Each has a purpose that can be used to build, save,
    feed, or survive; each tool also can be used to maim, kill, destroy, and ruin.
    For you to understand how to use social engineering to build, feed, survive, or
    save, you need to understand both uses. This is especially true if your goal is
    to defend. Defending yourself and others from malicious uses of social engineering
    requires that you step over into the dark side of it to get a clear picture of
    how it is used.'

    she mentioned that she often has to meet with real federal agents who work serial-killer
    cases to prepare herself for playing the role of JJ on the show. The same idea
    applies directly to this book.

    like some infallible instructor. If they have knowledge, thoughts, or even feelings
    that contradict something I say, I want to discuss it with them. I love learning
    and expanding my understanding on these topics. I extend the same request to you.
