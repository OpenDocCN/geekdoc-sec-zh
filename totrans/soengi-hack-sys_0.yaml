- en: Social engineering is an incredibly effective process of attack with more than
    80% of cyber attacks, and over 70% of those from ­nation-states, being initiated
    and executed by exploiting humans rather than computer or network security flaws.
    Thus to build secure cyber systems, it is not only necessary to protect the computers
    and networks that make up these systems but also to educate and train their human
    users about security procedures as well.

- en: Attacks on humans are called social engineering because they manipulate or engineer
    users into performing desired actions or divulging sensitive information. The
    most general social engineering attacks simply attempt to get unsuspecting Internet
    users to click on malicious links. More focused attacks attempt to elicit sensitive
    information, such as passwords or private information from organizations or steal
    things of value from particular individuals by earning unwarranted trust.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These attacks generally ask people to perform the desired behavior that the
    attacker wants to induce from the victim. To do this, they need the victim’s trust,
    which is typically earned through interaction or co-opted via a copied or stolen
    identity. Depending on the level of sophistication, these attacks will go after
    individuals, organizations, or wide swathes of the population. Scammers often
    use familiar company names or pretend to be someone known to the victim. A 2018
    real-world example exploited the name of Netflix when an email designed to steal
    personal information was sent to an unknown number of recipients. The email claimed
    the user’s account was on hold because Netflix was having some trouble with their
    current billing information and invited the user to click on a link to update
    their payment method. [¹](#re_TNF-CH001_CIT00001)

    it for malicious endeavors is ages old. Social engineering attacks have occurred
    on the Internet since it came into existence. But before the growth of the Internet,
    criminals used the telephone, the postal service, or advertising to pose as a
    trusted agent to acquire information. Most people agree that the term phishing
    originated in the mid-1990s, when it was used to describe the acquisition of Internet
    service provider (ISP) account information. However, the term has evolved to encompass
    a variety of attacks that target personal or corporate information possessed by
    individuals, including by telephone, email, social media, in person observation,
    gaming platforms, theft of postal delivery letters or packages, and, an age-old
    favorite, dumpster diving or trash picking.

    their names and business affiliations (something that is fairly easy to do in
    person as well), but also extending to their gender, age, and location (identifiers

    fraud schemes, such as Ponzi schemes, that are now being carried out in virtual
    worlds. Other con artists are able to conduct identity theft crimes by misidentifying
    themselves on social networking sites and then tricking their victims into giving
    them their account names and passwords as well as other personally identifiable
    information.

    personal or corporate information. Originally, phishing was identified as the
    use of electronic mail messages, designed to look like messages from a trusted
    agent, such as a bank, auction site, or online commerce site. These messages usually
    implore the user to take some form of action, such as validating their account
    information. They often use a sense of urgency (such as the threat of account
    suspension) to motivate the user to take action. Recently, there have been several
    new social engineering approaches to deceive unsuspecting users. These include
    the offer to fill out a survey for an online banking site with a monetary reward
    if the user includes account information, and email messages claiming to be from
    hotel reward clubs, asking users to verify credit card information that a customer
    may store on the legitimate site for reservation purposes. Included in the message
    is a uniform resource locater (URL) for the victim to use, which then directs
    the user to a site to enter their personal information. This site is crafted to
    closely mimic the look and feel of the legitimate site. The information is then
    collected and used by the criminals. Over time, these fake emails and websites
    have evolved to become more technically deceiving to casual investigation. [⁴](#re_TNF-CH001_CIT00004)

    email(s) from a trusted source even though that is not the case. Phishing attacks
    on social networking site users come in various formats, including messages within
    the social networking site either from strangers or compromised friend accounts;
    links or videos within a social networking site profile claiming to lead to something
    harmless that turns out to be harmful; or emails sent to users claiming to be
    from the social networking site itself. Social networking site users fall victim
    to the schemes due to the higher level of trust typically displayed while using
    social networking sites. Users often accept into their private sites people that
    they do not actually know, or sometimes fail to properly set privacy settings
    on their profile. This gives cyber thieves an advantage when trying to trick their

    with enormous amounts of information to be able to create official-looking documents
    and send them to individual targets who have shown interest in specific subjects.
    The personal and detailed nature of the information erodes the victim’s sense
    of caution, leading them to open the malicious email. Such an email will contain
    an attachment that holds malicious software designed to provide the email’s sender
    with control over the victim’s entire computer. By the time the malware infection
    is discovered, it is often too late to protect the data from compromise.

    access, steal, or modify data without detection. Coders of advanced malware are
    patient and have been known to test a network and its users to evaluate defensive
    responses. Malware, also known as malicious code, refers to a program that is
    covertly inserted into another program with the intent to destroy data, run destructive
    or intrusive programs, or otherwise compromise the confidentiality, integrity,
    or availability of the victim’s data, applications, or operating system. Malware
    is the most common external threat to most hosts, causing widespread damage and
    disruption and necessitating extensive recovery efforts within most organizations.
    Advanced malware may use a layered approach to infect and gain elevated privileges
    on a system. Usually, these types of attacks are bundled with an additional cybercrime
    tactic, such as social engineering or zero day exploits. Malware is often employed
    to misappropriate information and data that can be readily used such as login
    credentials, credit card and bank account numbers, and, in some cases, trade secrets.

    the user or system, they can further exploit it using other vectors that may give
    them deeper access to system resources. In the second phase, the hacker might
    install a backdoor to establish a persistent presence on the network that can
    no longer be discovered through the use of anti-virus software or firewalls.

    sensitive information about their victims. This can be done by criminal actors
    on either a large or small scale. For example, in a large-scale data mining scheme,
    a cybercriminal may send out a “getting to know you” quiz to a large list of social
    networking site users. While the answers to these questions do not appear to be
    malicious on the surface, they often mimic the same questions that are asked by
    financial institutions or email account providers when an individual has forgotten
    their password. Thus, an email address and the answers to the quiz questions can
    provide the cybercriminal with the tools to enter a bank account, email account,
    or credit card account in order to transfer money or siphon the account. Small-scale
    data mining may also be easy for cybercriminals if social networking site users
    have not properly guarded their profile or access to sensitive information. Indeed,
    some networking applications encourage users to post whether or not they are on
    vacation, simultaneously letting burglars know when nobody is home. [⁵](#re_TNF-CH001_CIT00005)

    agencies, and academic institutions, and other organizations can and have become

    email attachments that contained the malware. But more recently, we are seeing

    growing problem is ransomware that locks down mobile phones and demands payments

    steps to neutralize some of the more significant ransomware scams through law
    enforcement actions against major botnets that facilitated the distribution and

    known as Citadel, falsely warned victims that their computers had been identified
    by the FBI or Department of Justice as being associated with child pornography
    websites or other illegal online activity. In June 2013, Microsoft, the FBI, and
    financial partners disrupted a massive criminal botnet built on the Citadel malware,
    putting the brakes on Reveton’s distribution. Cryptolocker was a highly sophisticated
    ransomware that used cryptographic key pairs to encrypt the computer files of
    its victims and demanded ransom for the encryption key. In June 2014, the FBI
    announced in conjunction with the Gameover Zeus botnet disruption that the United
    States and international law enforcement officials had seized the Cryptolocker
    command and control servers. [⁶](#re_TNF-CH001_CIT00006)

    United States, Russia, Ukraine, Estonia, Italy, Hong Kong, Japan, and Canada.
    The $9 million loss occurred within a span of less than 12 hours. The cyber underground

    warned home buyers about an email and money wiring scam in 2016\. Hackers had
    been breaking into some consumers’ and real estate professionals’ email accounts
    to get information about upcoming real estate transactions. After figuring out
    the closing dates, the hacker would send an email to the buyer, posing as the
    real estate professional or title company. The bogus email would say there had
    been a last minute change to the wiring instructions, and tell the buyer to wire
    closing costs to a different account. But it would be the scammer’s account. If
    the buyer took the bait, their bank account could be cleared out in a matter of
    minutes. Often, that would be money the buyer would never see again.

    a user’s calendar to be able to show your friends’ birthdays, maps to show where
    the user’s friends live, and address book to show their pictures. To do this,
    Facebook enabled people to log in to apps and share who their friends were and
    some information about them. Then, in 2013, a Cambridge University researcher
    named Aleksandr Kogan created a personality quiz app. It was installed by around
    300,000 people who agreed to share some of their Facebook information as well
    as some information from their friends whose privacy settings allowed it. Given
    the way the platform worked at that time meant Kogan was able to access some information
    about tens of millions of friends. In 2014, to prevent abusive apps, Facebook
    announced that they were changing the entire platform to dramatically limit the
    Facebook information apps could access. Most importantly, apps like Kogan’s could
    no longer ask for information about a person’s friends unless their friends had
    also authorized the app. Facebook also required developers to get approval from
    Facebook before they could request any data beyond a user’s public profile, friend
    list, and email address. These actions would prevent any app like Kogan’s from
    being able to access as much Facebook data today.

    to, including Cambridge Analytica, formally certify that they had deleted all
    improperly acquired data. Later Facebook learned from The Guardian, The New York

    they had certified. Facebook immediately banned them from using any Facebook services.

    like hacking and malware for years. Leading up to Election Day in November 2016,
    Facebook detected and dealt with several threats with ties to Russia. This included
    activity by a group called APT28 that the US government had publicly linked to
    Russian military intelligence services. But while the primary focus was on traditional
    threats, Facebook also saw some new behavior in the summer of 2016 when APT28-related
    accounts, under the banner of DC Leaks, created fake personas that were used to
    seed stolen information to journalists. Facebook shut these accounts down for
    violating policies. After the election, Facebook continued to investigate and
    learn more about these new threats and found that bad actors had used coordinated
    networks of fake accounts to interfere in the election: Promoting or attacking
    specific candidates and causes, creating distrust in political institutions, or
    simply spreading confusion. Some of these bad actors also used Facebook ad tools
    as phishing tools to draw people deeper into the myriad of misinformation and
    disinformation. Facebook also learned about a disinformation campaign run by the
    Internet Research Agency (IRA) a Russian agency that has repeatedly acted deceptively
    and tried to manipulate people in the United States, Europe, and Russia. Facebook
    found about 470 accounts and pages linked to the IRA, which generated around 80,000
    Facebook posts over about a two-year period. The best estimate is that approximately
    126 million people may have been served content from a Facebook page associated
    with the IRA at some point during that period. On Instagram, where data on reach
    is not as complete, about 120,000 pieces of content were found, and the estimate
    is that an additional 20 million people were likely served it. Over the same period,
    the IRA also spent approximately $100,000 on more than 3,000 ads on Facebook and
