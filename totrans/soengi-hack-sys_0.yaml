    80% of cyber attacks, and over 70% of those from ­nation-states, being initiated
    and executed by exploiting humans rather than computer or network security flaws.
    Thus to build secure cyber systems, it is not only necessary to protect the computers
    and networks that make up these systems but also to educate and train their human
    users about security procedures as well.

- en: Attacks on humans are called social engineering because they manipulate or engineer
    users into performing desired actions or divulging sensitive information. The
    most general social engineering attacks simply attempt to get unsuspecting Internet

- en: These attacks generally ask people to perform the desired behavior that the
    attacker wants to induce from the victim. To do this, they need the victim’s trust,
    which is typically earned through interaction or co-opted via a copied or stolen
    identity. Depending on the level of sophistication, these attacks will go after
    individuals, organizations, or wide swathes of the population. Scammers often
    use familiar company names or pretend to be someone known to the victim. A 2018
    real-world example exploited the name of Netflix when an email designed to steal
    personal information was sent to an unknown number of recipients. The email claimed
    the user’s account was on hold because Netflix was having some trouble with their
    current billing information and invited the user to click on a link to update
    their payment method. [¹](#re_TNF-CH001_CIT00001)

    trusted agent to acquire information. Most people agree that the term phishing
    originated in the mid-1990s, when it was used to describe the acquisition of Internet
    service provider (ISP) account information. However, the term has evolved to encompass
    a variety of attacks that target personal or corporate information possessed by
    individuals, including by telephone, email, social media, in person observation,
    gaming platforms, theft of postal delivery letters or packages, and, an age-old
    favorite, dumpster diving or trash picking.

- en: Today the term phishing has evolved to encompass a variety of attacks that target
    personal or corporate information. Originally, phishing was identified as the
    use of electronic mail messages, designed to look like messages from a trusted
    agent, such as a bank, auction site, or online commerce site. These messages usually
    implore the user to take some form of action, such as validating their account
    information. They often use a sense of urgency (such as the threat of account
    suspension) to motivate the user to take action. Recently, there have been several
    new social engineering approaches to deceive unsuspecting users. These include
    the offer to fill out a survey for an online banking site with a monetary reward
    if the user includes account information, and email messages claiming to be from
    hotel reward clubs, asking users to verify credit card information that a customer
    may store on the legitimate site for reservation purposes. Included in the message
    is a uniform resource locater (URL) for the victim to use, which then directs
    the user to a site to enter their personal information. This site is crafted to
    closely mimic the look and feel of the legitimate site. The information is then
    collected and used by the criminals. Over time, these fake emails and websites
    have evolved to become more technically deceiving to casual investigation. [⁴](#re_TNF-CH001_CIT00004)

    and organized computer fraud attacks ever conducted. The crime group used sophisticated
    hacking techniques to compromise the encryption used to protect data on 44 payroll
    debit cards, and then provided a network of cashers to withdraw more than $9 million
    from over 2,100 ATMs in at least 280 cities worldwide, including cities in the
    United States, Russia, Ukraine, Estonia, Italy, Hong Kong, Japan, and Canada.
    The $9 million loss occurred within a span of less than 12 hours. The cyber underground
    facilitates the exchange of cybercrime services, tools, expertise, and resources,
    which enables this sort of transnational criminal operation to take place across
    multiple countries.

    valuable information can be inadvertently exposed by military or government personnel
    via their social networking site profile. In a recently publicized case, an individual
    created a fake profile on multiple social networking sites posing as an attractive
    female intelligence analyst and extended friend requests to government contractors,
    military personnel, and other government personnel. Many of the friend requests
    were accepted, even though the profile was of a fictitious person. According to
    press accounts, the deception provided its creator with access to a fair amount
    of sensitive data, including a picture from a soldier taken on patrol in Afghanistan
    that contained embedded data identifying his exact location. The person who created
    the fake social networking profiles, when asked what he was trying to prove, responded:
    The first thing was the issue of trust and how easily it is given. The second
    thing was to show how much different information gets leaked out through various

    a user’s calendar to be able to show your friends’ birthdays, maps to show where
    the user’s friends live, and address book to show their pictures. To do this,
    Facebook enabled people to log in to apps and share who their friends were and
    some information about them. Then, in 2013, a Cambridge University researcher
    named Aleksandr Kogan created a personality quiz app. It was installed by around
    300,000 people who agreed to share some of their Facebook information as well
    as some information from their friends whose privacy settings allowed it. Given
    the way the platform worked at that time meant Kogan was able to access some information
    about tens of millions of friends. In 2014, to prevent abusive apps, Facebook
    announced that they were changing the entire platform to dramatically limit the
    Facebook information apps could access. Most importantly, apps like Kogan’s could
    no longer ask for information about a person’s friends unless their friends had
    also authorized the app. Facebook also required developers to get approval from
    Facebook before they could request any data beyond a user’s public profile, friend

    Russian military intelligence services. But while the primary focus was on traditional

    accounts, under the banner of DC Leaks, created fake personas that were used to
    seed stolen information to journalists. Facebook shut these accounts down for
    violating policies. After the election, Facebook continued to investigate and

    networks of fake accounts to interfere in the election: Promoting or attacking

    with the IRA at some point during that period. On Instagram, where data on reach
    is not as complete, about 120,000 pieces of content were found, and the estimate
    is that an additional 20 million people were likely served it. Over the same period,
    the IRA also spent approximately $100,000 on more than 3,000 ads on Facebook and
    Instagram, which were seen by an estimated 11 million people in the United States.
    Facebook shut down these IRA accounts in August 2017. [^(13)](#re_TNF-CH001_CIT00013)'

    that, in the course of the US Congress investigating Russia’s interference in
    the 2016 election, the extent to which many Internet technologies were exploited
    and their providers repeatedly caught wrong-footed has been unmistakable. More
    than illuminating the capacity of these technologies to be exploited by bad actors,
    the revelations of 2018 have revealed the dark underbelly of an entire ecosystem.
    The speed with which these products have grown and come to dominate nearly every
    aspect of our social, political, and economic lives has in many ways obscured
    the shortcomings of their creators in anticipating the harmful effects of their
    use. The Government has failed to adapt and has been incapable or unwilling to
    adequately address the impacts of these trends on privacy, competition, and public
    discourse.

    we ensure proper oversight, transparency, and effective management of technologies
    that in large measure undergird our social lives, our economy, and our politics.
    Numerous opportunities exist to work with these companies, other stakeholders,
    and policymakers to make sure that we are adopting appropriate safeguards to ensure
    that this ecosystem no longer exists as “the Wild West”—unmanaged and not accountable
    to users or broader society—but instead operates to the broader advantage of society,
    competition, and broad-based innovation.

    impersonation, or other forms of deception. The inspector general for the Social
    Security Administration (SSA) has warned the public and social security beneficiaries
    in particular to be aware of fraud scams that target personal information. Scammers
    use phone calls, emails, and other methods to obtain personal information, then
    use it to commit identity theft. In recent scams, identity thieves posed as government
    officials in an attempt to convince people to provide personal and financial information.
    They may claim to be SSA employees—or Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
    employees, in the wake of Hurricane Sandy—and ask for social security numbers
    and bank information to make sure that people can receive their benefits. Scammers
    may also claim that a person has won a lottery or other prize, but they must send
    money to pay fees, taxes, or other expenses before they can claim their winnings.

    SSN, or IRS records show that they earned income from an employer they don’t know.
    Or, the IRS may reject their e-filed tax return as a duplicate filing. Tax scammers
