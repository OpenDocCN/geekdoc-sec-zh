    execute. It is no surprise then that these tools play a major role in security
    analysis and hardening of relevant binary code.

- en: Often the only practical way to protect all binaries with a particular security
    hardening method is to have the compiler do it. And, with software security becoming
    more and more important in recent years, it is no surprise to see an ever increasing
    variety of security hardening features and mitigations against vulnerabilities
    implemented in compilers. Indeed, compared to a few decades ago, today’s compiler
    developer is much more likely to implement security features than not.

- en: Furthermore, with the ever-expanding range of techniques implemented, it’s very
    hard to gain a basic understanding of all security features implemented in typical
    compilers.

    security hardening features, yet it’s hard to gain a good, basic understanding
    of such compiler features.'

- en: There are a lot of materials that explain individual vulnerabilities or attack
    vectors. There are also lots of presentations explaining specific exploits. But
    there seems to be a limited set of materials that give a structured overview of
    all vulnerabilities and exploits against which a code generator plays a role in
    protecting.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book aims to provide such a structured, broad overview. It does not necessarily
    go into full details, instead aiming to give a thorough description of all relevant
    high-level aspects of attacks, vulnerabilities, mitigations, and hardening techniques.
    For further details, this book provides pointers to materials with more details
    on specific techniques.

    that needs to learn about software security relevant to compilers. Even though
    the focus is on compiler developers, we expect that this book will also be useful
    to people working on other low-level software.

- en: The idea for this book emerged out of a frustration of not finding a good overview
    on this topic. Kristof Beyls and Georgia Kouveli, both compiler engineers working
    on security features, wished a book like this would exist. After not finding such
    a book, they decided to try and write one themselves. They immediately realized
    that they do not have all necessary expertise themselves to complete such a daunting
    task. So they decided to try and create this book in an open source style, seeking
    contributions from many experts.

- en: As you read this, the book remains unfinished. This book may well never be finished,
    as new vulnerabilities continue to be discovered regularly. Our hope is that developing
    the book as an open source project will allow for it to continue to evolve and
    improve. The open source development process of this book increases the likelihood
    that it remains relevant as new vulnerabilities and mitigations emerge.

    vulnerabilities. So what is the plan to get high quality content to cover all
    relevant topics? It is two-fold.
  prefs: []

- en: First, by studying specific topics, they hope to gain enough knowledge to write
    up a good summary for this book.

    in potentially contributing content, please go to the home location for the open

    items throughout this book. This is an example “TODO” item
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    contributors. Readers get hints of what kind of further content is still missing.
    Potential contributors get hints for where we need help to further improve this
    book.
