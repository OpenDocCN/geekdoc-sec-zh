- en: Annually, I attend a number of security conferences around the world. One speaker
    that I never miss is Johnny Long. Not only is Johnny one of the most entertaining
    speakers on the security circuit, his presentations are filled with interesting
    ideas that are corner stoned in what should be the first defense in security mitigation.
    Common sense.

  zh: 每年，我都会参加世界各地的安全会议。我绝不会错过的一个演讲者就是约翰尼·朗。约翰尼不仅是安全领域中最有趣的演讲者之一，他的演讲中还充满了有趣的想法，这些想法都基于一个基石，那就是安全减缓中应该是第一道防线的常识。
- en: Not only does Johnny challenge you not to ignore the obvious and to be more
    aware of your surroundings, his no tech hacking takes on a MacGyver approach to
    bypassing expensive security technology that sometimes are wholly relied upon
    to secure data and the premises.

  zh: 约翰尼不仅挑战你不要忽视显而易见的事实并更加警觉周围环境，他的无技术黑客手法采用了麦克盖弗式的方法，绕过昂贵的安全技术，有时这些技术完全依赖于保护数据和场所。
- en: Every day, corporations spend thousands of dollars on high-tech security defenses,
    but fail to give attention to the simple bypasses that no-tech hackers can leverage
    to their benefit. In this book Johnny presents eye-opening exploits that security
    professionals must take into consideration. In their haste to complete tasks and
    move along to the next topic, many security managers are overlooking simple flaws
    that render their high-dollar technologies, useless.

  zh: 每天，各大公司花费数千美元投入高科技安全防御，却忽略了无技术含量的简单漏洞，这些漏洞正是无技术黑客可以利用的。在这本书中，约翰尼提出了令人瞠目结舌的攻击手法，安全专业人士必须考虑到这些漏洞。在匆忙完成任务并转向下一个话题的过程中，许多安全经理忽略了简单的缺陷，导致他们花费巨资购买的技术变得毫无用处。
- en: It is this complacency by security departments to ignore the simple threats;
    attackers are given the upper hand during a compromise. An intruder will always
    pursue the path of least resistance in an attack, while many businesses plan for
    the Mission Impossible scenario. Johnny will surprise you by bypassing a physical
    lock with a hand towel, tailgating behind a group of employees to enter a building,
    digging in the trash to uncover sensitive proprietary information, using Google
    and P2P networks to dig up sensitive information posted by internal employees
    and consumers alike, and then showing you how all of these things pooled together
    may provide the open door for an attacker to exploit you.

  zh: 安全部门对简单威胁的忽视导致了这种自满；在威胁发生时，攻击者占据了上风。入侵者总是选择攻击中最易逾越的路径，而许多企业则计划应对不可能完成的任务。约翰尼将通过用手巾绕过物理锁，跟在一群员工后面进入建筑物，搜寻垃圾桶以揭示敏感专有信息，利用谷歌和P2P网络挖掘内部员工和消费者发布的敏感信息，然后向你展示，所有这些事情汇集在一起可能为攻击者提供攻击的开门机会。
- en: The most overlooked factor in securing a business is the people factor. The
    most expensive technologies will provide you no benefit if an attacker can call
    up an employee and convince them to turn it off or alter its setting to create
    a window of opportunity. Social engineering is perhaps the hacker’s favorite weapon
    of choice. Why waste time on an elaborate technical compromise, when you can make
    a few phone calls to gather seemingly innocuous information from unsuspecting
    people and leverage them into opening the door?

  zh: 安全业务中最容易被忽视的因素是人为因素。即使是最昂贵的技术也无法为您提供任何好处，如果攻击者可以打电话给一名员工并说服他们关闭它或更改其设置以制造时机。社会工程可能是黑客最喜欢的武器。为什么要浪费时间进行复杂的技术妥协，当你可以打几个电话从毫不知情的人那里收集看似无害的信息，并利用它们打开大门呢？
- en: In my past life as a black-hat hacker, social engineering enabled me to get
    my foot in the door in record time—minutes. Afterwards, I would have to find and
    exploit technical flaws to achieve my objectives. The example of social engineering
    that Jack Wiles provided in this book may appear to be too good to be true. It
    isn’t. And that’s just a single pretext—the human imagination could think of many,
    many more. The question is, would you or your co-workers, employers, or mom and
    dad fall for it? The chapter on social engineering will offer insight on how no-tech
    hackers manipulate their victims into what is probably the most common method
    of attack for which no technological solution will safeguard your information.

  zh: 在我作为一个黑客的前生中，社会工程学让我以创纪录的速度——几分钟内就能进入门槛。之后，我必须找到并利用技术漏洞来实现我的目标。杰克·怀尔斯在这本书中提供的社会工程学例子可能看起来太好以至于不真实。但事实并非如此。这只是一个单一的借口，人类的想象力可以想出许多许多更多。问题是，你或你的同事、雇主、父母会上当吗？社会工程学章节将揭示无技术黑客如何操纵他们的受害者，这可能是最常见的攻击方法，没有技术解决方案能保护您的信息。
- en: Both consumers and businesses will find valuable information that creates awareness,
    within the pages of Johnny’s *No-Tech Hacking.* This book clearly illustrates
    the often-ignored threats that IT managers should take into consideration when
    designing security plans to protect their business. Not only will business find
    the content of this book riveting, consumers will also garner knowledge on methods
    to protect themselves from identity theft, burglary, and hardening their defenses
    on home systems maintained by a computer. Much like his *Google Hacking,* Johnny
    has once again offered an entertaining but thought-provoking look into hacking
    techniques and the ingenuity being utilized by your adversaries.

  zh: 消费者和企业都会在《约翰尼的无技术黑客》的页面中找到有价值的信息，这将引起他们的警觉。这本书清楚地说明了IT经理在设计安全计划以保护他们的业务时应考虑的经常被忽视的威胁。不仅企业会发现本书的内容引人入胜，消费者也将获得保护自己免受身份盗窃、入室盗窃以及加固家用计算机系统防御的方法。就像他的《Google黑客》一样，约翰尼再次提供了一个有趣但发人深省的窥视黑客技术和对手所利用的创造力。
