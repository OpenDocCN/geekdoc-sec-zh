- en: Annually, I attend a number of security conferences around the world. One speaker
    that I never miss is Johnny Long. Not only is Johnny one of the most entertaining
    speakers on the security circuit, his presentations are filled with interesting
    ideas that are corner stoned in what should be the first defense in security mitigation.
    Common sense.

- en: Not only does Johnny challenge you not to ignore the obvious and to be more
    aware of your surroundings, his no tech hacking takes on a MacGyver approach to
    bypassing expensive security technology that sometimes are wholly relied upon
    to secure data and the premises.

- en: Every day, corporations spend thousands of dollars on high-tech security defenses,
    but fail to give attention to the simple bypasses that no-tech hackers can leverage
    to their benefit. In this book Johnny presents eye-opening exploits that security
    professionals must take into consideration. In their haste to complete tasks and
    move along to the next topic, many security managers are overlooking simple flaws
    that render their high-dollar technologies, useless.

- en: It is this complacency by security departments to ignore the simple threats;
    attackers are given the upper hand during a compromise. An intruder will always
    pursue the path of least resistance in an attack, while many businesses plan for
    the Mission Impossible scenario. Johnny will surprise you by bypassing a physical
    lock with a hand towel, tailgating behind a group of employees to enter a building,
    digging in the trash to uncover sensitive proprietary information, using Google
    and P2P networks to dig up sensitive information posted by internal employees
    and consumers alike, and then showing you how all of these things pooled together
    may provide the open door for an attacker to exploit you.

- en: The most overlooked factor in securing a business is the people factor. The
    most expensive technologies will provide you no benefit if an attacker can call
    up an employee and convince them to turn it off or alter its setting to create
    a window of opportunity. Social engineering is perhaps the hacker’s favorite weapon
    of choice. Why waste time on an elaborate technical compromise, when you can make
    a few phone calls to gather seemingly innocuous information from unsuspecting
    people and leverage them into opening the door?

- en: In my past life as a black-hat hacker, social engineering enabled me to get
    my foot in the door in record time—minutes. Afterwards, I would have to find and
    exploit technical flaws to achieve my objectives. The example of social engineering
    that Jack Wiles provided in this book may appear to be too good to be true. It
    isn’t. And that’s just a single pretext—the human imagination could think of many,
    many more. The question is, would you or your co-workers, employers, or mom and
    dad fall for it? The chapter on social engineering will offer insight on how no-tech
    hackers manipulate their victims into what is probably the most common method
    of attack for which no technological solution will safeguard your information.

- en: Both consumers and businesses will find valuable information that creates awareness,
    within the pages of Johnny’s *No-Tech Hacking.* This book clearly illustrates
    the often-ignored threats that IT managers should take into consideration when
    designing security plans to protect their business. Not only will business find
    the content of this book riveting, consumers will also garner knowledge on methods
    to protect themselves from identity theft, burglary, and hardening their defenses
    on home systems maintained by a computer. Much like his *Google Hacking,* Johnny
    has once again offered an entertaining but thought-provoking look into hacking
    techniques and the ingenuity being utilized by your adversaries.
