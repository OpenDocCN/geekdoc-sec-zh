  zh: 摘要
- en: A common misconception is that all attacks are purely technical in nature. Social
    engineering is the art of gaining trust or acceptance in order to persuade someone
    to provide information or perform an action to benefit the attacker. The attacker
    then combines the newly acquired information, which is usually obtained through
    research and multiple attacks, with a technical attack to produce a result that
    is disastrous to the target.

    to the cigarette in his mouth while struggling to hold his umbrella. “Yeah, just
    great,” agreed Jerry as he blew out a cloud of smoke toward the windows of an
    office building. Taking another drag, Jerry asked, “Did you catch the game last
    night?” Mark flicked some ashes to the ground, “Nah, the wife wanted to check
    out some new tapas place. Spent 70 bucks and I'm still hungry.” Jerry smirked
    as the two men extinguished their smokes. “Yeah, I know how that goes,” he said
    with a nod as Mark swiped his access card and held the door as Jerry shook the
    rain from his jacket and then stepped inside the building. The men went opposite
    ways in the hallway. Mark returned to his desk to take an incoming call. Jerry
    found an empty conference room to set up his laptop and then began stealing the
    company's data.

    马克把一些烟灰丢到地上，“没有啊，老婆想去尝尝一家新的塔帕斯餐厅。花了70块钱，我还是饿。” 杰瑞冷笑着，两个男人熄灭了烟。 “是啊，我知道那是什么感觉，”他点了点头，马克刷了一下他的门禁卡，然后把门拉开，杰瑞从他的夹克衫上摇掉雨水，然后走进了大楼。
    两人在走廊上朝相反的方向走去。马克回到他的办公桌接听电话。杰瑞找了一个空的会议室，打开他的笔记本电脑，然后开始窃取公司的数据。

- en: Social engineering is the art of gaining trust or acceptance in order to persuade
    someone to provide information or perform an action to benefit the attacker. Even
    though most social engineering attacks are nontechnical, when combined with technical
    attacks, the results can be disastrous for the target. Famous hacker Kevin Mitnick
    coined the term social engineering in his first book The Art of Deception. Using
    persuasion and deception in combination with technical attacks, Mitnick was able
    to infiltrate organizations such as Pacific Bell and Nortel before his apprehension
    in 1995\. Upon his release in 2000, Mitnick founded Mitnick Security Consulting
    and is now one of the most sought-after computer experts in the world.

- en: Not all hackers fit the stereotype of an antisocial teenager living in his mom's
    basement; the same applies to social engineers. Most social engineers are highly
    extroverted and have no qualms about chatting up a stranger. In order to manipulate
    the trust of people, one must be willing to talk to them. Usually, they dress
    to blend into the environment but occasionally dress to stand out if the situation
    is right. It also isn't safe to assume that all social engineers and hackers are
    men. Women are perceived to be less threatening than men, which enable them to
    be very effective attackers. Above all, they are likeable people who make others
    they come in contact with feel good about them.

- en: 'From a young age, we''re taught “The Golden Rule: Treat others the way you
    want to be treated.” When we see someone struggling, our first reaction is to
    help him or her. This is especially true if the person indicates that he or she
    will get in trouble if the target doesn''t help. Social engineering uses our psychological
    makeup against us by striving for empathy from the target. Empathy is the drive
    to identify another person''s emotions and/or thoughts and respond with the appropriate
    emotion. Lastly, these types of attacks are effective because many people are
    unaware of what social engineering attacks are and the threat they pose.'

    The attacker uses these smaller pieces of information to create a cover story,
    or pretext, to perform an attack. The goal of a pretext is to pass the age-old

    anyone else for that matter) wants to know what's going on in an organization,
    all they need to do is go to lunch. Hitting the popular restaurants and cafes
    around the target location is a no-risk method for gathering data. If two or more
    coworkers are together for any length of time, it's almost inevitable that they
    will “talk shop.” The larger the group, the more detailed the conversation. When
    I train security professionals in the ways of social engineering, one of their
    assignments is to go out to lunch and do nothing but listen to conversations around
    them and take notes. There's usually a prize waiting for whoever brings back the
    juiciest story. The next time you're in a restaurant or coffee shop, try it for
    yourself and see what knowledge can be gained by simply listening. Employees of
    the target company are usually easy to spot based on the forgotten ID card dangling
    from their neck or corporate shirts and jackets. This is also a fantastic opportunity
    to learn company lingo.

    States. Locating their web-based e-mail and VPN sites had been trivial with some
    customized search terms. The websites didn't require certificate-based authentication,
    and from what Sarah could tell without valid login credentials, two-factor authentication
    was not in place. This meant that all she needed was a valid username and password
    to access the company's resources. Using the tool FOCA, Sarah examined the metadata
    in various documents and presentations located on the company website. The metadata
    search yielded ten usernames using the scheme first initial and last name. Now
    that Sarah understood the username format, she could easily deduce usernames with
    only the employee's name. Then Sarah searched Facebook for employees of the target
    company and discovered 43\. Of those 43 profiles, 20 of them were completely open
    to the public. Open profiles reveal all data that have been entered into Facebook,
    including the user's status updates. Sarah compiled a list of female employees
    with open Facebook profiles and began searching for additional information, such
    as signature blocks and office phone numbers.

    spoofing program to make her number appear as Natalie's cell phone. A pleasant-sounding
    young man answered. “Help desk, this is Paul. How may I help you?” Using her best
    “whiny voice,” Sarah replied. “Hi Paul. This is Natalie Green from the Denver
    office. I changed my password earlier this week, and now I can't remember it.
    It wouldn't be such a big deal if I wasn't on call this week.” She said with a
    sigh. Paul gave a knowing chuckle “Understand that all too well. Let's get you
    back online Natalie. I just need your office phone number to verify your identity.”
    Sarah blinked in surprise. Could it really be this easy? She bit her tongue to
    hold back the excitement. “Sure thing, Paul.” She replied and proceeded to read
    the phone number from her notes. The line went quiet, but Sarah could hear typing
    and the low melody of Christmas music in the background. “You're all set, Natalie.
    I set your password to ‘2013Denver$,’ but you'll have to change it once you log
    in.” Sarah smiled and let out an audible sigh of relief. “Thanks a lot Paul. I
    really appreciate your help tonight. I hope you aren't stuck there tomorrow too.”
    Paul replied “Thankfully no, but I'll be here the rest of the night if you run
    into any more problems.” Sarah began typing in Natalie's username and new password
    to verify they were in working order. “Looks like I’m good to go. Thanks again
    Paul. Have a Merry Christmas!” Sarah now had unrestricted access to Natalie's
    account for the entire week. Prior to Natalie's scheduled return, Sarah installed

- en: A major area of focus is the company website. Are you providing too much information?
    An online employee directory, while helpful to customers, is a gold mine for social
    engineers. In most cases, listing key customer-focused employees provides customers
    with the point of contact without listing everyone who works at the company. Superfluous
    job postings can provide details about software deployed in your environment.
    Announcing your brand of antivirus and other deployed security technologies to
    the world is like putting out the welcome mat for attackers. Metadata analysis
    is a key part of the assessment to determine if usernames, passwords, and operating
    system details are exposed in documents that are posted on your website.

- en: Another portion of the assessment is searching for leaked documents. Not all
    of these documents are discovered via Google. Peer-to-peer networks, social media,

    or with personal equipment. While vishing may seem out of date, it is still an
    extremely useful tool for attackers because their targets don't have time to think
    the situation through prior to providing information to the attacker. Focus your
    initial simulated phone attacks against employees that mainly deal with the public.

- en: ■ Metadata—Ensure your audience understands metadata and how it is used against
    them. Provide tutorials on how to remove metadata from documents before publication.
    Many of the Microsoft Office programs have this functionality built-in, but not
    enabled.

    e-mail address. It should never be used to subscribe to forums, mailing lists,
    or other special interest groups. Not only does it expose company technology,
    but also it can also be used to craft spear phishing attacks posing as a mailing

- en: The most important step in preventing social engineering attacks is teaching
    your workforce that it's ok to ask questions. If someone is attempting to tailgate
    in the door, it's ok for an employee to ask, “Can you scan your badge please?”
    It's ok to place a caller on hold while you contact their manager for verification.
    The objective of every awareness program should be to educate employees on reporting
    suspicious behavior to the security team, not to become security professionals
    themselves. For many organizations, this will require a culture change. Management
    is more likely to approve of this paradigm shift if they understand the threat,
    so be prepared to educate your management on these types of attacks.

  zh: 防止社会工程攻击的最重要步骤是教育您的员工，提问是可以的。如果有人试图尾随进门，员工可以问：“您可以扫描您的工作证吗？”在联系其经理进行验证时，可以把电话接通等待。每个意识计划的目标应该是教育员工向安全团队报告可疑行为，而不是让他们成为安全专家。对于许多组织来说，这将需要文化转变。如果他们了解威胁，管理层更有可能批准这种范式转变，因此准备好向管理层介绍这些类型的攻击。

    the impact of successful ones. Effective defensive technologies likely exist in
    your environment but could improve with configuration changes. Rather than reviewing
    configurations line by line, focus on the big picture with brainstorming sessions,
    beginning with high-level scenarios that involve key technical members of the
    cyber security team. This tactic is widely used in the defense industry under
    the term tabletop exercise and usually involves multiple military branches and
    civilian agencies. A tabletop exercise is a discussion-based event of scripted
    scenarios in an informal environment. Usually facilitator-led, these exercises
    enable security teams to walk through an attack scenario step-by-step to review

    can have a broad scope and include many areas of review, or a narrow focus to
    highlight specific areas, such as detection and preventative capabilities of deployed
    technology. A tabletop exercise is inexpensive to perform and can also serve as
    on-the-job training for new employees. Don't forget to get input from some of
    the staff that is actually doing the jobs. As some tasks look good on paper, there
    may be several other related tasks from other groups that are required and are
    relied on for full support of their job function.

- en: ■ Username makeover—Attackers can enumerate usernames easily using tactics discussed
    earlier in the chapter, such as gathering names via social media. Usernames that
    are not based on names or any other identifiable characteristics complicate social
    engineering attacks because the attacker isn't able to quickly determine the username
    associated with the employee they wish to target. Instead of using vthomas for
    a username, consider a unique identifier such as HN90346283\. Not only would this
    change make actions more difficult for attackers, but also it would make threat
    detection and log analysis easier for the cyber security team. Login attempts
    from usernames that stray from the unique identifiers would be an obvious attempted
    attack, enabling the cyber security team to properly investigate the involved
    machines. Because this type of change would impact everyone in the organization,
    the initial stages of deployment may have negative effects, such as an increase
    of help desk calls from employees that have forgotten their new username. A username
    makeover would also require support from senior management, as it would require
    a culture change for the organization to utilize the new format.

  zh: ■ 用户名改头换面 — 攻击者可以轻松枚举用户名，利用本章前面讨论过的策略，比如通过社交媒体收集名字。基于名字或任何其他可识别特征的用户名会使社会工程攻击复杂化，因为攻击者无法快速确定与他们希望攻击的员工相关联的用户名。与其使用vthomas作为用户名，考虑使用一个唯一标识符，比如HN90346283。这种改变不仅会使攻击者的行动变得更加困难，还会使网络安全团队的威胁检测和日志分析变得更容易。来自与唯一标识符不符的用户名的登录尝试将是明显的攻击尝试，使网络安全团队能够适当地调查涉及的机器。由于这种类型的改变会影响组织中的每个人，部署的初始阶段可能会产生负面影响，比如来自忘记新用户名的员工的帮助台呼叫增加。用户名改头换面还需要高级管理支持，因为这将需要组织文化变革以利用新的格式。
- en: ■ Domain purchases—Social engineers prey on their victim's inability to spot
    small details in attacks. A popular tactic for phishing attacks is to purchase
    a domain similar to the target's primary domain. For instance, if your primary
    domain is [www.myorganization.com](http://www.myorganization.com), an attacker
    would purchase [www.myogranization.com](http://www.myogranization.com) or [www.my-organization.com](http://www.my-organization.com)
    so that the malicious link would appear legitimate at first glance. These malicious
    domains can also be used to attack your organization's customers if they mistype
    your website address and inadvertently visit the attacker's website. Creating
    e-mail accounts from the malicious domain adds credibility to phishing messages,
    as the e-mail address appears to be from within your organization. Purchasing
    domains that are similar to your organizations will decrease the risk of attackers
    using fictitious websites and e-mail addresses to lure their targets. Include
    popular domain extensions such as .org and .net in your purchases for maximum
    prevention.

  zh: ■ 域购买 — 社会工程师利用受害者无法察觉攻击中的细微细节。钓鱼攻击的一个常用策略是购买一个类似目标主要域的域。例如，如果你的主要域是[www.myorganization.com](http://www.myorganization.com)，攻击者将购买[www.myogranization.com](http://www.myogranization.com)或[www.my-organization.com](http://www.my-organization.com)，这样恶意链接乍一看会显得合法。如果用户误输入您的网站地址并意外访问攻击者的网站，这些恶意域也可以用来攻击您组织的客户。从恶意域注册电子邮件帐户会增加钓鱼消息的可信度，因为电子邮件地址看起来来自您的组织内部。购买与您组织相似的域将降低攻击者使用虚构网站和电子邮件地址来诱骗目标的风险。在购买时包括流行的域扩展名，如.org和.net，以实现最大的预防效果。
- en: ■ Webmail addresses—Registering webmail addresses, such as [myorganizationadmin@yahoo.com](mailto:myorganizationadmin@yahoo.com),
    reduces the likelihood of an attacker utilizing a webmail provider to launch phishing
    attacks. If an attacker is unable to purchase a convincing domain or create a
    convincing webmail account, the chances of their attacks being detected by spam
    filters increases.

  zh: ■ 网页邮件地址 — 注册网页邮件地址，如[myorganizationadmin@yahoo.com](mailto:myorganizationadmin@yahoo.com)，可以降低攻击者利用网页邮件提供商发起钓鱼攻击的可能性。如果攻击者无法购买一个令人信服的域或创建一个令人信服的网页邮件帐户，他们的攻击被垃圾邮件过滤器检测到的机会就会增加。

    changes based on the results of each phase. Environment changes can include technology,
    policy, employee education, organizational culture, or modifications to physical
    security controls. Preventing social engineering attacks is a continuous process,
    which will require periodic repetitions of each SEDF phase.
