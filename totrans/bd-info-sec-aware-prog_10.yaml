- en: A common misconception is that all attacks are purely technical in nature. Social
    engineering is the art of gaining trust or acceptance in order to persuade someone
    to provide information or perform an action to benefit the attacker. The attacker
    then combines the newly acquired information, which is usually obtained through
    research and multiple attacks, with a technical attack to produce a result that
    is disastrous to the target.

    someone to provide information or perform an action to benefit the attacker. Even
    though most social engineering attacks are nontechnical, when combined with technical
    attacks, the results can be disastrous for the target. Famous hacker Kevin Mitnick
    coined the term social engineering in his first book The Art of Deception. Using
    persuasion and deception in combination with technical attacks, Mitnick was able
    to infiltrate organizations such as Pacific Bell and Nortel before his apprehension
    in 1995\. Upon his release in 2000, Mitnick founded Mitnick Security Consulting
    and is now one of the most sought-after computer experts in the world.

    basement; the same applies to social engineers. Most social engineers are highly
    extroverted and have no qualms about chatting up a stranger. In order to manipulate
    the trust of people, one must be willing to talk to them. Usually, they dress
    to blend into the environment but occasionally dress to stand out if the situation
    is right. It also isn't safe to assume that all social engineers and hackers are
    men. Women are perceived to be less threatening than men, which enable them to
    be very effective attackers. Above all, they are likeable people who make others
    they come in contact with feel good about them.

    makeup against us by striving for empathy from the target. Empathy is the drive

    all they need to do is go to lunch. Hitting the popular restaurants and cafes
    around the target location is a no-risk method for gathering data. If two or more
    coworkers are together for any length of time, it's almost inevitable that they
    will “talk shop.” The larger the group, the more detailed the conversation. When
    I train security professionals in the ways of social engineering, one of their
    assignments is to go out to lunch and do nothing but listen to conversations around
    them and take notes. There's usually a prize waiting for whoever brings back the
    juiciest story. The next time you're in a restaurant or coffee shop, try it for
    yourself and see what knowledge can be gained by simply listening. Employees of
    the target company are usually easy to spot based on the forgotten ID card dangling
    from their neck or corporate shirts and jackets. This is also a fantastic opportunity
    to learn company lingo.

    engineering to obtain access. Often, physical security assessments are performed
    in conjunction with a network penetration test. Physical security basics and assessments
    are covered in detail in [Chapter 8](B9780124199675000089.xhtml).

    impact. The best training session I have ever attended was for a government agency
    and began with a video of an agency employee telling an adversary sensitive details
    of a critical defense project. Except the “adversary” was an undercover agent
    attempting to social engineer information from him; and it worked. Once the video
    was over, the auditorium was absolutely silent. This short, homemade video was
    a true eye-opener for the audience. It clearly dictated the message “These threats
    are real and you could be the next target.” The remainder of the session went
    on to detail how these attacks worked and what to do if you suspected that you
    were being targeted.

    e-mail address. It should never be used to subscribe to forums, mailing lists,

    list update.

    number can be faked. Discuss what employees should do if they receive a suspicious
    call. How do they report it?

- en: ■ Physical attacks—As we discussed earlier in the chapter, sometimes, the easiest
    way into a target environment is literally through the door. Emphasize the impact
    of tailgating attacks and the procedures for visitors.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The most important step in preventing social engineering attacks is teaching
    your workforce that it's ok to ask questions. If someone is attempting to tailgate
    in the door, it's ok for an employee to ask, “Can you scan your badge please?”
    It's ok to place a caller on hold while you contact their manager for verification.
    The objective of every awareness program should be to educate employees on reporting
    suspicious behavior to the security team, not to become security professionals
    themselves. For many organizations, this will require a culture change. Management
    is more likely to approve of this paradigm shift if they understand the threat,
    so be prepared to educate your management on these types of attacks.

    the impact of successful ones. Effective defensive technologies likely exist in
    your environment but could improve with configuration changes. Rather than reviewing
    configurations line by line, focus on the big picture with brainstorming sessions,
    beginning with high-level scenarios that involve key technical members of the
    cyber security team. This tactic is widely used in the defense industry under
    the term tabletop exercise and usually involves multiple military branches and
    civilian agencies. A tabletop exercise is a discussion-based event of scripted
    scenarios in an informal environment. Usually facilitator-led, these exercises
    enable security teams to walk through an attack scenario step-by-step to review

    highlight specific areas, such as detection and preventative capabilities of deployed
    technology. A tabletop exercise is inexpensive to perform and can also serve as
    on-the-job training for new employees. Don't forget to get input from some of
    the staff that is actually doing the jobs. As some tasks look good on paper, there
    may be several other related tasks from other groups that are required and are

    attacks:'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: ■ Username makeover—Attackers can enumerate usernames easily using tactics discussed
    earlier in the chapter, such as gathering names via social media. Usernames that
    are not based on names or any other identifiable characteristics complicate social
    engineering attacks because the attacker isn't able to quickly determine the username
    associated with the employee they wish to target. Instead of using vthomas for
    a username, consider a unique identifier such as HN90346283\. Not only would this
    change make actions more difficult for attackers, but also it would make threat
    detection and log analysis easier for the cyber security team. Login attempts
    from usernames that stray from the unique identifiers would be an obvious attempted
    attack, enabling the cyber security team to properly investigate the involved
    machines. Because this type of change would impact everyone in the organization,
    the initial stages of deployment may have negative effects, such as an increase
    of help desk calls from employees that have forgotten their new username. A username
    makeover would also require support from senior management, as it would require
    a culture change for the organization to utilize the new format.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: ■ Domain purchases—Social engineers prey on their victim's inability to spot
    small details in attacks. A popular tactic for phishing attacks is to purchase
    a domain similar to the target's primary domain. For instance, if your primary
    domain is [www.myorganization.com](http://www.myorganization.com), an attacker
    would purchase [www.myogranization.com](http://www.myogranization.com) or [www.my-organization.com](http://www.my-organization.com)
    so that the malicious link would appear legitimate at first glance. These malicious
    domains can also be used to attack your organization's customers if they mistype
    your website address and inadvertently visit the attacker's website. Creating
    e-mail accounts from the malicious domain adds credibility to phishing messages,
    as the e-mail address appears to be from within your organization. Purchasing
    domains that are similar to your organizations will decrease the risk of attackers
    using fictitious websites and e-mail addresses to lure their targets. Include
    popular domain extensions such as .org and .net in your purchases for maximum
    prevention.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: ■ Webmail addresses—Registering webmail addresses, such as [myorganizationadmin@yahoo.com](mailto:myorganizationadmin@yahoo.com),
    reduces the likelihood of an attacker utilizing a webmail provider to launch phishing
    attacks. If an attacker is unable to purchase a convincing domain or create a
    convincing webmail account, the chances of their attacks being detected by spam
    filters increases.
