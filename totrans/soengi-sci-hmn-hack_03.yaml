    bytes). One source even tells us that the Internet can contain up to 10 yottabytes
    of total data. (Writing 10 yottabytes looks like this: 10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000

- en: Why is the amount of traffic on the Internet even remotely important to understand?
    Well, for example, if you are looking to send a spear-phish, your goal might be
    to look for personal hobbies, likes, dislikes, and things the target finds valuable.
    But if you are going to vish your target, then you might want to find details
    about the target's job, what role the person plays in the work organization, and
    what kinds of internal and external resources that person would expect calls from.
    If your goal is to get onsite, then you need to know whether the target would
    meet with people and who those people would be.

    It is centered on former Director of the FBI James Comey. An Internet blogger

    out an emergency spider spraying. We called our company Big Blue Pest Control
    and came with full Big Blue outfits and spray bottles of custom blue “poison”

    just some blue Gatorade in a spray bottle.

    to work up a document on a target containing details about the target's personal
    life. Those details are often used to further attack the target, humiliate them,
    or perpetrate other crimes.

    easy and fun to use. In addition, the guys at Paterva (the company that makes
    Maltego) offer amazing training videos and courses. Finally, Maltego is made for
    every platform.
