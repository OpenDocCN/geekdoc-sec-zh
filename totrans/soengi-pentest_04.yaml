    engineering. There are various definitions, some vague and others precise, and
    these will be discussed in order to explain what the concept of social engineering
    is really about. Everyday examples will be used to show the reader the various
    forms of social engineering used, highlighting how such techniques are not necessarily
    confined to the realm of criminal activity.

    discuss some of the excellent examples from various movies. With the assistance
    of poetic license, writers have been able to create wonderful examples of how
    social engineering could potentially be used. Although these examples are of course
    fictitious, they are in fact based on very real techniques, providing criminal
    minds with inspiration as well as providing entertainment.

    to that must be yes. Social engineering is not an exact science, often involving
    the application of very creative thinking. This book aims to present very logical
    and structured models to aid in social engineering assessments, however, it does
    not mean that social engineering can be completely reduced to an absolute “if
    A set of actions then B.” The models presented in this book help to ensure value
    for the client through accurate and thorough assessments. However, once these
    models have been followed the social engineer can apply all manner of creative
    spins on the scenarios, providing of course that they don’t then contradict the
    advice of the models used in the first place.

    human nature rather than those of a computer system. The terms, “human hacking”
    and “hacking wetware” have been used in obscure security articles and some “cyberpunk”
    inspired novels to describe social engineering methods. A typical social engineer
    may use myriad psychological techniques to manipulate their target, these can
    range from leveraging emotional states through to clever sentence structure and
    personality profiling. The techniques used vary greatly and so social engineering
    can be thought of as an eclectic collection of manipulation techniques. However,
    it is not just limited to psychological trickery. Social engineers may use props
    and disguises and even go to the great lengths of creating entire scenarios involving
    many different stages to achieve their objectives. The techniques can also be
    applied to other platforms such as telephone calls or e-mail, not just face-to-face
    encounters.

    techniques are successful sales persons. The average sales person has one simple
    objective: to sell their service or product to their client. In order to do this
    the sales person will not simply ask the client if they would like to buy, but
    rather leverage every possible available technique to influence the client’s decision.
    A very simplistic example would be the use of open rather than closed questions.
    A closed question can be answered with a simple “Yes” or “No” whereas an open
    question requires a lengthier, often less absolute answer. For example, the sales
    person may say:'

    to find something they have in common to talk about. Mentioning your latest golf
    exploits at the end of the meeting may well gain favor with a client that has
    a keen interest in the sport. Some sales persons may take this even further by
    actually profiling their client, reading any available information associated
    with the subject to provide a better “sales pitch.” This initial reconnaissance
    is mirrored in the first stages of a social engineering attack with the target
    company and the staff research. Social engineers will harvest as much information
    as they can to increase the chances of perpetrating a successful attack. Consequently,
    both salesmen and social engineers will take full advantage of getting to know
    their targets very well.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Additionally social engineers may try to impersonate individuals to elicit sensitive
    information from their targets. Similarly, the successful sales person may also
    try impersonation in an attempt to gain a foothold for the sales process. For
    example, impersonating staff members simply to get a direct telephone number to
    a particular department or specific staff member or to elicit information on competing
    sales companies. Social engineers will contact the target company to elicit similar
    information to aid in further attacks. The only difference is the ultimate objective
    with the salesman wanting a sale and the social engineer wanting to gain access
    to sensitive information or to gain information they can use to attack the company
    in some other way.

    examples of social engineering techniques. The main character Martin Bishop runs
    a Tiger Team^([2](#FN2)) style company who specialize in breaking security systems,
    with the aim of helping the client better defend against similar attacks. The
    team are approached by government officials and pressured into retrieving a mysterious
    “black box” device from the famous mathematician Dr. Gunter Janek. The box is
    believed to have been built for the former Soviet government and the United States
    are concerned that it may be a case of national security. Martin and his team
    retrieve the box, discovering that it is able to break any US encryption scheme.
    Martin hands the box over to the government officials but soon realizes that they
    were in fact impostors and his team then has to pull off their most difficult
    mission yet to get the box back and into safe hands.

    to perform the task of retrieving the black box device is an excellent example
    of multiple social engineering techniques. The two government officials are impostors,
    actually working for a criminal organization. Martin is duped and drawn into their
    plot by a number of factors. First, the two officials present plausible facades
    as government officials: they have what appears to be the correct credentials,
    talk like government officials and even produce information that Martin presumes
    only a government would have. All these reaffirm their credibility and so to Martin
    the two men look, sound and act exactly like the people they are trying to impersonate.
    They both put pressure on Martin and make him focus on an ultimatum: help them
    or have his real identity as a computer hacker used against him. In doing so they
    successfully manipulate Martin into agreeing to help them, all the time keeping
    his attention fixed on his situation and leaving no room for doubting their actual
    identities. Despite performing similar impersonations countless times, Martin
    falls for their scam completely. The social engineering element of this scene
    is the combination of impersonation, choice of words and subtly guiding the victim
    to focus on the right elements.'

- en: For Martin to achieve his objective he needs to break into the building where
    the black box is initially located, by gaining access through reception. Again,
    this is accomplished by using more than one social engineering technique. One
    of the team members approaches reception claiming that they have a delivery to
    take inside. The receptionist refuses to allow them entry and the team member
    continues to try and convince the receptionist to make an exception, claiming
    that they may lose their job. This is already an attempt to invoke guilt in the
    target to try and make them comply. Simultaneously, Martin approaches the desk
    asking if his wife had dropped a cake off, referencing the second floor of the
    building. The purpose of this is to plant the seed of credibility while the receptionist
    is distracted. The receptionist then returns to arguing with the delivery driver.
    Martin leaves before returning with a cake and balloons, asking the receptionist
    to release the locking mechanism as he has no hands free to retrieve his card
    (a card he doesn’t have). With the receptionist distracted by the delivery driver
    and an ensuing argument, Martin then shouts at the receptionist to “*Push the
    damn buzzer will you!*” Of course the receptionist immediately does so to escape
    the increasingly stressful situation. The two team members both impersonate different
    individuals and play out a scenario designed to confuse, disorientate and stress
    the receptionist, manipulating him into opening the door for Martin. The situation
    or scenario is entirely plausible and that results in the security being breached
    without anyone knowing. The receptionist was not forced into doing something they
    knew would result in a breach, they caused a breach but would probably never realize
    they did. From the receptionist’s perspective, Martin would have had access in
    any other case. This creation of a plausible situation adding in the elements
    of impersonation and emotional manipulation is a superb example of social engineering
    in action.

    systems. His first target is the OTV Studios television network where he gains
    the initial foothold on the computer network using social engineering techniques.
    Dade calls up the security desk impersonating a Mr Eddie Vedder from the accounting
    department. The security desk employee (Norm) answers the phone. Eddie explains
    that he has just had a power surge at his home, which has wiped out a file he
    was just working on. He expresses the seriousness of the situation claiming that
    he is in big trouble and asks “*Do you know anything about computers?*” Norm responds
    with a somewhat apprehensive, “*Err…Gee*.” Dade now knows that the employee certainly
    isn’t confident with computers and therefore his pretext is more likely to be
    successful. Dade continues “*My BLT drive on my computer just went AWOL and I
    have this big project due tomorrow for* *Mr Kawasaki*.” Throwing in a few abbreviations,
    he continues to make the security desk employee feel more inadequate to deal with
    the situation, giving Dade the upper hand. He also stresses the importance of
    the project claiming “*If I screw up, he’ll make me commit hari-kari*.” This increases
    the pressure on the target so that when a solution is presented they’ll grab it.
    Dade then asks “*Could you read me the number on the modem?*” The security desk
    employee jumps at the opportunity to escape the situation and happily reads off
    the number. Having possession of the modem number, Dade is able to connect to
    the television studio’s networks.

    train restaurant coach. He looks around for a victim and discovers a female character
    sitting alone at a table. His main objective is to trick the woman into paying
    for his meal. From that moment, before he has even sat down, he begins to play
    out the social engineering scenario. He immediately removes his hat and puts on
    an expression of sadness, putting himself into character. He asks if he may sit
    opposite the woman and she agrees. When the waiter asks if he’d like to see the
    menu he says “*Oh yes…. Starving…. Really starving*” then on seeing the menu comments
    on the prices and asks the waiter for water. Straight away he is building up his
    pretext, planting the seeds of sympathy in the victim’s mind. This is more effectively
    accomplished as Freddy isn’t directly conversing with the victim, instead ensuring
    they overhear the conversation. This indirect manipulation adds credibility to
    the pretext, as the victim is unlikely to think they are being targeted if they
    are not being spoken to directly. The female character then comments on him ordering
    water when he is so hungry, Freddy explains that he is saving his money to pay
    for his ill grandmother’s hospital bills. He continues saying that he’s never
    been good with money, returning what little money the Red Cross pays him. All
    of this is obviously designed to invoke feelings of sympathy in the victim. Freddy
    then finishes by saying his grandmother taught him to always be truthful and good.
    This last comment about being good presents a way out for the victim. The female
    character feels sorry for Freddy, she can’t help his grandmother but she can be
    “good” and at least pay for a meal for him, seeing as how he’s “really starving.”

    even Nicholas’ own family. The impersonation lead to Frédéric being collected
    by Nicholas’ sister and taken back to the United States where he lived with the

    the supposedly secure unit, Frédéric had successfully extracted all manner of
    sensitive information about the family and had manipulated their behavior, ensuring
    that any interactions were consistent with their real child. This is effectively

    for the social engineer. Communication is reduced down to a single channel and
    is therefore more easily controlled. The social engineer does not need to worry
    about visual issues such as how they’re dressed, how they look or what their body
    language is saying. They only need to have the right sounding voice, speak consistently
    with that of the impersonated individual and create a plausible situation. When
    Frédéric contacted Nicholas’ family to inform them that their child had been found
    he sounded professional and concerned, just like a social worker. The family had
    no reason to doubt the caller and so his impersonation was successful.

    the individual that found Nicholas through to Nicholas himself. The string of
    impersonations built up credibility and strengthened the ruse. Criminal social
    engineers often use similar methods, making quick simple phones calls to elicit

    what the family expected. His eye color was wrong, he was much taller than they
    thought he would be and he was incapable of speaking English without an accent.
    Perhaps the family did know of the impersonation, or perhaps the want for their
    child was strong enough to cause a significant amount of denial. Whatever the
    case was, it still stands that the power of impersonation can be significantly
    enhanced if the victim truly wants to believe.

    Parker and the FBI agent Nancy Fisher. In the film Frédéric comments that he believed
    at least some of the family members knew he was an impostor. He told police that
    he believed the family had been involved in the disappearance of Nicholas and
    therefore found Frédéric’s impersonation to be a useful turn of events. Whatever
    the truth was, Frédéric’s case is one of the most remarkable examples of the power
    of impersonation.

    States. Aged 16 he used social engineering and hacking techniques to break into
    the computer systems of dozens of companies. He would often not need to use any
    technical methods to break into his target company. Rather, he would use a variety
    of social engineering techniques to trick users into revealing the required credentials
    or telephone numbers he needed. He was first convicted in 1998 and sentenced to
    12 months in prison with 3 years supervised release. Toward the end of his supervised
    release he successfully hacked into the Pacific Bell mail systems, leading to
    a warrant for his arrest. Kevin fled, spending two and a half years as a fugitive
    until his apprehension on February 15th, in North Carolina. When arrested, he
    was found in possession of cloned mobile phones and many forms of false identification.
    His remarkable use of social engineering is wonderfully described in his books
    “The Art of Deception”, “The Art of Intrusion” and “Ghost in the Wires”. Kevin
    now works as a security consultant helping business to defend against such attacks.

    “Catch Me If You Can” or the film adaptation. He demonstrated an extraordinary
    use of social engineering techniques impersonating an airline pilot, a college
    professor, a lawyer and a doctor to name just a few. In addition he had successfully
    cashed $2.5 million in fraudulent checks all over the world. These exploits inevitably
    led to his apprehension by French police in 1969 and serving multiple sentences
    in France, Sweden and the United States. During this time he successfully escaped
    incarceration on more than one occasion. On his release he tried to hold onto
    a series of legitimate jobs but as soon as companies learned of his criminal past,
    they would terminate his employment. As with Kevin Mitnik, Frank now works as
    a security consultant giving advice to companies including the FBI.

    firm RSA’s network. RSA are well known for their two-factor authentication system
    (SecurID), providing users with a secure way to log in to systems. The target
    of the attack was the proprietary information associated with that SecurID token
    system, allegedly wanted to aid in separate attacks against other security firms.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The hackers were able to achieve their objective by combining traditional technical
    hacking skills with social engineering techniques. They sent spear phishing e-mails
    to relatively low-privileged staff members of RSA containing a Microsoft Excel
    spreadsheet attachment labeled “2011 Recruitment Plan”. Spear phishing e-mails
    are a more targeted type of the traditional spam-like phishing e-mails most people
    are familiar with. They may be tailored to a specific individual rather than being
    a generic format applicable to a wide audience. The bespoke nature of the spear
    phishing e-mail makes it an extremely effective attack technique. A full breakdown
    of performing a spear phishing attack is covered in [Chapter 9](CHP009.xhtml).
  prefs: []

- en: The “2011 Recruitment Plan” title of the e-mail attachment was designed to entice
    the user to open it. The attachment was of course malicious and exploited a flaw
    in Flash that had not yet been publicly revealed. This exploit opened up a “back
    door” to the victim’s computer, allowing the attackers to then use traditional
    network penetration techniques to access the target systems. Having located the
    proprietary information, the attackers exfiltrated the data to an external location.
    RSA managed to detect the attack but were too late to prevent the loss of sensitive
    information.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this case the bulk of the attack was very technical in nature, leveraging
    a flaw in Flash and elevating privileges on the network. However, the initial
    delivery mechanism that provided the foothold on the network was achieved through
    social engineering. Reduced down to the most basic level, the perpetrators had
    to manipulate a user into doing something that established a remote connection
    back to their computers. This could be accomplished in many ways such as downloading
    and running a program, browsing to a malicious web site or, in this case, opening
    a malicious Microsoft Office document. The attackers could have approached reception
    impersonating a new starter and ask them to print off their curriculum vitae (CV),
    which just happened to be a malicious PDF document. They could have telephoned
    the staff impersonating the IT department asking the users to browse to specific
    sites for troubleshooting purposes. In this case, they chose the least risky option
    in that e-mails are notoriously difficult to trace back to the source. The e-mail
    would probably have looked right and had an enticing enough attachment to trick
    the users into opening it, successfully manipulating them into performing the
    required action.

    realized what they had done. The document would have opened and may have contained

    systems and searched the network for their ultimate objective.

    terrorist intent on assassinating the Queen or President George Bush, I could
    have done so with absolute ease.” Ryan was able to walk freely around the Palace

    content via *The Financial Times*’ web sites and social media accounts.

    of the successes were due to social engineering techniques. The SEA were able
    to trick staff members of *The Financial Times* into revealing their Gmail account

    crafted spear phishing e-mails.

    members. The e-mails’ sender could have been spoofed, or the attacker may have
    already compromised some legitimate e-mail accounts. Either way the recipients
    of the e-mail would likely have believed it to be a reliable source. The e-mail
    contained a link to a CNN article, which of course actually linked to a compromised
    web site that then linked to a malicious web site. The malicious web site was
    a clone of *The Financial Times* e-mail login portal. If the user logged into
    this fake portal, the credentials would be logged and sent to the attackers. The
    user would then be redirected to the official Gmail account and not realize anything

    direct technical hacking techniques such as password attacks against login portals

    standard social engineering methodology of acquiring one piece of information
    to then acquire another more sensitive piece.

    to the social security numbers (SSNs) of their high-profile targets, then use
    this information along with other details to gain access to the XBox Live accounts.
    However, Microsoft claim to not store SSNs or link them in any way with XBox Live
    accounts. So how did the attackers use the SSN of their targets? The attackers
    used the SSN, along with social engineering techniques, to attack a third-party
    company that did utilize the SSN and also had information regarding the XBox Live
    accounts. It was this third-party company that was attacked, not Microsoft directly.

- en: This attack demonstrates two very common and effective social engineering techniques.
    The first is the concept of turning innocuous information into sensitive information.
    For example, the attackers may have had some snippets of personal information
    regarding the Microsoft employees. This may have been e-mail addresses, date of
    birth, etc. They then used this information, along with social engineering, to
    trick a company into revealing the employee’s SSN. Then the SSN can be used to
    trick the third-party company into resetting the password for the XBox Live account
    or whatever was required to gain access to it. The scope for this concept is great
    and it will be revisited many times throughout the subsequent chapters.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The second concept covered in this attack is the idea that the target information
    may be found in more than one location. For example, if an attacker wanted to
    acquire your bank details would they necessarily target your bank? Your account
    details will likely be stored in many different places by various companies. It
    may be far easier for an attacker to target your local gym who might store your
    bank details after you set up a direct debit with them. The security of any information
    is only as strong as the weakest place in which it is stored or used.

    acknowledge it. Most likely this may be due to a multitude of different reasons,
    such as the difficulty of balancing security and availability, investing in technology
    rather than people, and weaknesses in policies and procedures to name just a few.
