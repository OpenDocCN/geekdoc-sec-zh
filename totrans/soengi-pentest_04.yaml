- en: This chapter has the sole aim of introducing the reader to the concept of social
    engineering. There are various definitions, some vague and others precise, and
    these will be discussed in order to explain what the concept of social engineering
    is really about. Everyday examples will be used to show the reader the various
    forms of social engineering used, highlighting how such techniques are not necessarily
    confined to the realm of criminal activity.

    discuss some of the excellent examples from various movies. With the assistance
    of poetic license, writers have been able to create wonderful examples of how
    social engineering could potentially be used. Although these examples are of course
    fictitious, they are in fact based on very real techniques, providing criminal
    minds with inspiration as well as providing entertainment.

    communication in all its possible manifestations with the objective of exploiting
    the human factor. Therefore, where there is interaction there is always the capacity
    and potential for social engineering. The most fundamental example of this would
    be the act of lying. Although the historical roots of individuals committing immoral
    acts is beyond the scope of this book, it is important to note that social engineering
    is as old as communication itself.

  zh: 这个定义将社会工程简化为利用沟通的各种可能表现形式，以利用人为因素为目标的绝对基础。因此，在互动中总是存在社会工程的能力和潜力。其中最基本的例子就是说谎的行为。虽然个体进行不道德行为的历史根源超出了本书的范围，但重要的是要注意，社会工程与沟通本身一样古老。

    engineering regarded as an art form? The authors of this book believe the answer
    to that must be yes. Social engineering is not an exact science, often involving
    the application of very creative thinking. This book aims to present very logical
    and structured models to aid in social engineering assessments, however, it does
    not mean that social engineering can be completely reduced to an absolute “if
    A set of actions then B.” The models presented in this book help to ensure value
    for the client through accurate and thorough assessments. However, once these
    models have been followed the social engineer can apply all manner of creative
    spins on the scenarios, providing of course that they don’t then contradict the
    advice of the models used in the first place.

  zh: 考虑到前一个定义中使用“*艺术*”一词，社会工程是否被视为一种艺术形式？本书的作者认为答案必定是肯定的。社会工程并非一门确切的科学，通常涉及非常有创造性的思维应用。本书旨在提供非常逻辑和结构化的模型，以帮助进行社会工程评估，然而，这并不意味着社会工程可以完全简化为绝对的“如果A组行动则B。”本书中提出的模型有助于通过准确和彻底的评估为客户提供价值。然而，一旦这些模型被遵循，社会工程师可以在情景中应用各种创造性的转折，前提是他们不会与首次使用的模型的建议相矛盾。
- en: The various social engineering techniques aim to exploit vulnerabilities in
    human nature rather than those of a computer system. The terms, “human hacking”
    and “hacking wetware” have been used in obscure security articles and some “cyberpunk”
    inspired novels to describe social engineering methods. A typical social engineer
    may use myriad psychological techniques to manipulate their target, these can
    range from leveraging emotional states through to clever sentence structure and
    personality profiling. The techniques used vary greatly and so social engineering
    can be thought of as an eclectic collection of manipulation techniques. However,
    it is not just limited to psychological trickery. Social engineers may use props
    and disguises and even go to the great lengths of creating entire scenarios involving
    many different stages to achieve their objectives. The techniques can also be
    applied to other platforms such as telephone calls or e-mail, not just face-to-face

  zh: 各种社会工程技术旨在利用人类本性的弱点，而不是计算机系统的弱点。术语“人类黑客”和“黑客湿件”已经在一些晦涩的安全文章和一些“赛博朋克”启发的小说中用来描述社会工程方法。典型的社会工程师可能使用多种心理技巧来操纵他们的目标，这些技巧可以从利用情绪状态到巧妙的句子结构和人格分析。使用的技术差异很大，因此社会工程可以被认为是一套多样化的操纵技术集合。然而，它不仅仅局限于心理诡计。社会工程师可能使用道具和伪装，甚至可能采取极端手段，创造涉及许多不同阶段的整个情景来实现他们的目标。这些技术也可以应用于其他平台，如电话或电子邮件，而不仅仅是面对面的相遇。

    objective: to sell their service or product to their client. In order to do this
    the sales person will not simply ask the client if they would like to buy, but
    rather leverage every possible available technique to influence the client’s decision.
    A very simplistic example would be the use of open rather than closed questions.

  zh: 可以说，参与社会工程技术的个人中最好的例子之一是成功的销售人员。普通销售人员有一个简单的目标：向客户销售他们的服务或产品。为了做到这一点，销售人员不会简单地问客户是否愿意购买，而是利用一切可能的技巧来影响客户的决定。一个非常简单的例子是使用开放式问题而不是封闭式问题。封闭式问题可以用简单的“是”或“否”回答，而开放式问题需要一个更长的、通常不那么绝对的答案。例如，销售人员可能会说：
- en: “So how many would you like to buy?” rather than “Would you like to buy it?”,
    or “How can I help you?” *rather than*, “Can I help you?”

    to find something they have in common to talk about. Mentioning your latest golf
    exploits at the end of the meeting may well gain favor with a client that has
    a keen interest in the sport. Some sales persons may take this even further by
    actually profiling their client, reading any available information associated
    with the subject to provide a better “sales pitch.” This initial reconnaissance
    is mirrored in the first stages of a social engineering attack with the target
    company and the staff research. Social engineers will harvest as much information
    as they can to increase the chances of perpetrating a successful attack. Consequently,
    both salesmen and social engineers will take full advantage of getting to know
    their targets very well.

- en: Additionally social engineers may try to impersonate individuals to elicit sensitive
    information from their targets. Similarly, the successful sales person may also
    try impersonation in an attempt to gain a foothold for the sales process. For
    example, impersonating staff members simply to get a direct telephone number to
    a particular department or specific staff member or to elicit information on competing
    sales companies. Social engineers will contact the target company to elicit similar
    information to aid in further attacks. The only difference is the ultimate objective
    with the salesman wanting a sale and the social engineer wanting to gain access
    to sensitive information or to gain information they can use to attack the company
    in some other way.

  zh: 此外，社会工程师可能会尝试冒充个人以从他们的目标那里获取敏感信息。类似地，成功的销售人员也可能尝试冒充以获取销售流程的立足点。例如，冒充员工仅仅是为了获取到某个部门或特定员工的直接电话号码，或者引诱有关竞争销售公司的信息。社会工程师将联系目标公司以获取类似的信息，以帮助进一步的攻击。唯一的区别在于销售员希望销售，而社会工程师希望获得对敏感信息的访问权或获得可以用于其他方式攻击公司的信息。
- en: Therefore it can be said that salesmen make the best social engineers, with
    their natural confidence, positive attitude, and experience of effective influencing
    techniques. Their sole purpose is to sell you a concept or an idea. However, when

    examples of social engineering techniques. The main character Martin Bishop runs
    a Tiger Team^([2](#FN2)) style company who specialize in breaking security systems,
    with the aim of helping the client better defend against similar attacks. The
    team are approached by government officials and pressured into retrieving a mysterious
    “black box” device from the famous mathematician Dr. Gunter Janek. The box is
    believed to have been built for the former Soviet government and the United States
    are concerned that it may be a case of national security. Martin and his team
    retrieve the box, discovering that it is able to break any US encryption scheme.
    Martin hands the box over to the government officials but soon realizes that they
    were in fact impostors and his team then has to pull off their most difficult
    mission yet to get the box back and into safe hands.

  zh: 1992年由菲尔·奥尔登·罗宾逊执导的电影《鞋匠》中充满了社会工程技术的绝佳示例。主角马丁·毕晓普经营着一家以“老虎队”风格为特色的公司，专门破解安全系统，旨在帮助客户更好地抵御类似攻击。该团队被政府官员接近，并被迫从著名数学家冈特·亚内克博士那里取回一个神秘的“黑匣子”设备。据信该盒子是为前苏联政府建造的，美国担心这可能涉及国家安全问题。马丁和他的团队取回了这个盒子，发现它能够破解任何美国的加密方案。马丁将盒子交给了政府官员，但很快意识到他们实际上是冒名顶替者，然后他的团队不得不执行迄今为止最困难的任务，将盒子夺回并交到安全之手。
- en: 'The scene where Martin is approached by the “government officials” and asked
    to perform the task of retrieving the black box device is an excellent example
    of multiple social engineering techniques. The two government officials are impostors,
    actually working for a criminal organization. Martin is duped and drawn into their
    plot by a number of factors. First, the two officials present plausible facades
    as government officials: they have what appears to be the correct credentials,
    talk like government officials and even produce information that Martin presumes
    only a government would have. All these reaffirm their credibility and so to Martin
    the two men look, sound and act exactly like the people they are trying to impersonate.
    They both put pressure on Martin and make him focus on an ultimatum: help them
    or have his real identity as a computer hacker used against him. In doing so they
    successfully manipulate Martin into agreeing to help them, all the time keeping
    his attention fixed on his situation and leaving no room for doubting their actual
    identities. Despite performing similar impersonations countless times, Martin
    falls for their scam completely. The social engineering element of this scene
    is the combination of impersonation, choice of words and subtly guiding the victim
    to focus on the right elements.'

  zh: 马丁被“政府官员”接近并被要求执行检索黑匣子设备的任务的场景是多种社会工程技术的绝佳示例。这两名政府官员是冒名顶替者，实际上是为一个犯罪组织工作。马丁被欺骗并被吸引到他们的阴谋中，原因有很多。首先，这两名官员展示了可信的政府官员外表：他们拥有看似正确的证件，说话像政府官员，甚至提供了马丁认为只有政府才会有的信息。所有这些都再次证实了他们的可信度，所以对于马丁来说，这两个人看起来、听起来和行动起来都像他们试图冒充的人。他们都对马丁施加压力，并让他专注于一个最后通牒：帮助他们，否则他作为一个计算机黑客的真实身份将被用来对付他。这样一来，他们成功地操纵马丁同意帮助他们，始终让他的注意力集中在他的处境上，不给怀疑他们真实身份的空间。尽管马丁已经无数次进行了类似的冒名顶替，但他完全上当受骗。这一场景的社会工程元素是冒名顶替、措辞选择和微妙地引导受害者关注正确的要素。
- en: For Martin to achieve his objective he needs to break into the building where
    the black box is initially located, by gaining access through reception. Again,
    this is accomplished by using more than one social engineering technique. One
    of the team members approaches reception claiming that they have a delivery to
    take inside. The receptionist refuses to allow them entry and the team member
    continues to try and convince the receptionist to make an exception, claiming
    that they may lose their job. This is already an attempt to invoke guilt in the
    target to try and make them comply. Simultaneously, Martin approaches the desk
    asking if his wife had dropped a cake off, referencing the second floor of the
    building. The purpose of this is to plant the seed of credibility while the receptionist
    is distracted. The receptionist then returns to arguing with the delivery driver.
    Martin leaves before returning with a cake and balloons, asking the receptionist
    to release the locking mechanism as he has no hands free to retrieve his card
    (a card he doesn’t have). With the receptionist distracted by the delivery driver
    and an ensuing argument, Martin then shouts at the receptionist to “*Push the
    damn buzzer will you!*” Of course the receptionist immediately does so to escape
    the increasingly stressful situation. The two team members both impersonate different
    individuals and play out a scenario designed to confuse, disorientate and stress
    the receptionist, manipulating him into opening the door for Martin. The situation
    or scenario is entirely plausible and that results in the security being breached
    without anyone knowing. The receptionist was not forced into doing something they
    knew would result in a breach, they caused a breach but would probably never realize
    they did. From the receptionist’s perspective, Martin would have had access in
    any other case. This creation of a plausible situation adding in the elements
    of impersonation and emotional manipulation is a superb example of social engineering
    in action.

  zh: 为了实现他的目标，马丁需要闯入最初存放黑匣子的建筑物，通过接待处获得进入权限。同样，这是通过使用多种社会工程技术来实现的。团队中的一名成员走到接待处声称他们有一个要送进去的包裹。接待员拒绝让他们进入，而团队成员继续努力说服接待员做出例外，声称他们可能会失去工作。这已经是试图在目标身上激发内疚感，以试图让他们顺从。与此同时，马丁走到柜台问他的妻子是否送了一个蛋糕，提到建筑物的二楼。这样做的目的是在接待员分心时种下可信度的种子。接待员然后回到与送货司机争论。马丁离开后带着蛋糕和气球回来，请求接待员释放锁定机制，因为他没有空手拿取他的卡（他没有卡）。在接待员被送货司机和随之而来的争吵分心时，马丁大声对接待员喊道：“*按下该死的按钮吧！*”当然，接待员立即这样做以逃离日益紧张的局面。两名团队成员分别扮演不同的个体，并演绎出一个旨在混淆、迷惑和压力接待员的情景，操纵他为马丁打开门。这种情况或情景完全是可信的，导致安全被突破而无人知晓。接待员并没有被迫做出他们知道会导致突破的事情，他们造成了突破，但可能永远不会意识到他们这样做了。从接待员的角度来看，马丁在任何其他情况下都会有权限。这种创造一个可信情况，加入冒充和情感操纵元素的做法是社会工程的一个绝佳示范。

    systems. His first target is the OTV Studios television network where he gains
    the initial foothold on the computer network using social engineering techniques.
    Dade calls up the security desk impersonating a Mr Eddie Vedder from the accounting
    department. The security desk employee (Norm) answers the phone. Eddie explains
    that he has just had a power surge at his home, which has wiped out a file he
    was just working on. He expresses the seriousness of the situation claiming that
    he is in big trouble and asks “*Do you know anything about computers?*” Norm responds
    with a somewhat apprehensive, “*Err…Gee*.” Dade now knows that the employee certainly
    isn’t confident with computers and therefore his pretext is more likely to be
    successful. Dade continues “*My BLT drive on my computer just went AWOL and I
    have this big project due tomorrow for* *Mr Kawasaki*.” Throwing in a few abbreviations,
    he continues to make the security desk employee feel more inadequate to deal with
    the situation, giving Dade the upper hand. He also stresses the importance of
    the project claiming “*If I screw up, he’ll make me commit hari-kari*.” This increases
    the pressure on the target so that when a solution is presented they’ll grab it.
    Dade then asks “*Could you read me the number on the modem?*” The security desk
    employee jumps at the opportunity to escape the situation and happily reads off
    the number. Having possession of the modem number, Dade is able to connect to
    the television studio’s networks.

    an expression of sadness, putting himself into character. He asks if he may sit

    on the prices and asks the waiter for water. Straight away he is building up his
    pretext, planting the seeds of sympathy in the victim’s mind. This is more effectively
    accomplished as Freddy isn’t directly conversing with the victim, instead ensuring
    they overhear the conversation. This indirect manipulation adds credibility to
    the pretext, as the victim is unlikely to think they are being targeted if they
    are not being spoken to directly. The female character then comments on him ordering
    water when he is so hungry, Freddy explains that he is saving his money to pay
    for his ill grandmother’s hospital bills. He continues saying that he’s never
    been good with money, returning what little money the Red Cross pays him. All
    of this is obviously designed to invoke feelings of sympathy in the victim. Freddy
    then finishes by saying his grandmother taught him to always be truthful and good.
    This last comment about being good presents a way out for the victim. The female
    character feels sorry for Freddy, she can’t help his grandmother but she can be
    “good” and at least pay for a meal for him, seeing as how he’s “really starving.”

- en: In this case the bulk of the attack was very technical in nature, leveraging
    a flaw in Flash and elevating privileges on the network. However, the initial
    delivery mechanism that provided the foothold on the network was achieved through
    social engineering. Reduced down to the most basic level, the perpetrators had
    to manipulate a user into doing something that established a remote connection
    back to their computers. This could be accomplished in many ways such as downloading
    and running a program, browsing to a malicious web site or, in this case, opening
    a malicious Microsoft Office document. The attackers could have approached reception
    impersonating a new starter and ask them to print off their curriculum vitae (CV),
    which just happened to be a malicious PDF document. They could have telephoned
    the staff impersonating the IT department asking the users to browse to specific
    sites for troubleshooting purposes. In this case, they chose the least risky option
    in that e-mails are notoriously difficult to trace back to the source. The e-mail
    would probably have looked right and had an enticing enough attachment to trick
    the users into opening it, successfully manipulating them into performing the
    required action.

  zh: 在这种情况下，攻击的主体大部分是技术性质的，利用了Flash中的一个漏洞并提升了网络权限。然而，提供网络立足点的初始传递机制是通过社会工程实现的。从最基本的层面来看，犯罪分子必须操纵用户做出某些事情，以建立与他们计算机的远程连接。这可以通过许多方式实现，例如下载并运行程序，浏览到恶意网站，或者在这种情况下，打开恶意的Microsoft
    Office文档。攻击者可以冒充新员工去前台，要求他们打印他们的简历（CV），而这份简历恰好是一个恶意的PDF文档。他们可以冒充IT部门致电员工，要求用户浏览特定网站以进行故障排除。在这种情况下，他们选择了风险最小的选项，因为电子邮件极其难以追溯到源头。这封电子邮件可能看起来很正常，并且附有足够诱人的附件，以欺骗用户打开它，成功地操纵他们执行所需的操作。

  zh: 本章总结了一些最近的真实世界社会工程攻击，展示了社会工程是如何作为一种有效的传输机制被利用的，使得攻击者能够突破目标的外围防御，无论是计算机网络还是建筑物等物理目标。
- en: These real-world attacks conveniently set the stage for the next chapter of
    this book, focusing on the social engineering threat to businesses. The subjects
    covered will explain how people have become the weakest link in a business’s security
    chain. Despite already being well known, businesses don’t appear to consistently
    acknowledge it. Most likely this may be due to a multitude of different reasons,
    such as the difficulty of balancing security and availability, investing in technology
    rather than people, and weaknesses in policies and procedures to name just a few.
    These concepts and more will be covered in detail, gaining a clearer picture as
    to why the security of businesses (both large and small) continue to be regularly
    breached.

  zh: 这些真实世界的攻击方便地为本书的下一章打下了基础，重点关注对企业的社会工程威胁。所涵盖的主题将解释人们如何成为企业安全链中最薄弱的一环。尽管这已经是众所周知的，但企业似乎并没有一致地承认这一点。最有可能的原因可能是因为诸多不同的原因，比如平衡安全和可用性的困难、投资于技术而非人员、以及政策和流程的弱点等等。这些概念以及更多内容将会详细介绍，从而更清楚地了解为什么企业（无论是大型还是小型）的安全仍然经常受到侵犯。
