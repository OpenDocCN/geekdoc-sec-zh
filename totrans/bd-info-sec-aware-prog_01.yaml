- en: Many people have asked me why I wanted to write a book on building an information
    security awareness program. While everyone knows having one is a great idea, no
    one really knows where to start. The purpose of this book is to lay out a plan
    to build a program from the ground up and then look at some way to measure the
    effectiveness of the program once it's in place.

- en: This book is meant to be a roadmap. One size won't always fit all, and there
    may be different routes to achieving the same goals in your organization. As I
    built information security awareness programs, I realized that documenting what
    I was doing and how I was doing it might be valuable to others who might need
    such information.
