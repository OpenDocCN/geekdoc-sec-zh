    into carrying out something misleading or deceptive act confidently and in control. 
    For instance, a social engineer may try to pose as an individual from a service
    company or even forge a badge just to gain access in a secure building.  The social
    engineer simply needs to act as if they belong there.  Thus, as a social engineer
    conveys control and confidence, they are able to put others in the building at
    ease.

    look for badges when they allow people to enter inside a venue.  They look for
    unusual postures.  For instance, security people can determine whether a fan is
    sneaking back to have a glimpse of the star.  They also know the people who are
    working for the event.

    hand.  Consequently, when they are able to ask questions to the target, they are
    able to control the conversation.  More often than not, social engineers start
    a conversation with a question, which can put the target immediately on the defense. 
    Thus, the target feels a social pressure to provide an appropriate or correct
    response.

    the key is not to become too comfortable.  For instance, companies should advise
    employees to be keen when it comes to allowing outsides enter the building.  Guests
    and even service providers should be checked thoroughly for credentials regardless
    if their faces may be familiar.

    social engineers use is reciprocation.  More often than not, when people are given
    gifts or favors, they feel the need to give in return whether or not they like
    the person giving something to them.  A social engineer may offer to hold the
    door for an individual who belongs in a company or offer cookies to a receptionist
    to gain access to the building.

    for a favor is crucial.  This is because the target might take the gift as a bribe
    when the social engineer immediately asks for a favor.  The target is likely to
    act uncomfortably when they perceive the gift as a bribe.  As such, a social engineer
    is inclined to giving a gift, say, to a guard or receptionist of a building in
    the morning and come back in the afternoon.  The social engineer may claim a mix-up,
    such as pretending that there was a confusion with an item or than an item was
    left in one of the rooms of the building after a meeting.  The guard or receptionist
    is likely to let the social engineer enter the building as an act of reciprocation
    for the latter's gift.

    specifically when someone is trying to offer them a gift.  In most cases, social
    engineers spend weeks in order to lay the foundation to establish a reciprocal
    relationship with their targets, leading them to access to secure or sensitive
    areas.

    of other individuals with a good sense of humor.  This fact does not escape the
    knowledge of most social engineers.  They know that they can use humor to gain
    information, get out of trouble, or win over a gatekeeper.  For instance, a social
    engineer may simply convey an upbeat impression to a security guard questioning
    them.  Social engineers usually give their targets the impression that they are
    not worried with the questioning.

    engineer may use humor during the call as the target is likely to volunteer sensitive
    information when the conversation is comfortable and fun.

    when they hear the work “because.”  In the said study, the second group cut in
    line to use a copy machine saying the following: “Excuse me, may I use the copy
    machine because I have five pages and I am in a hurry?”  This statement made 94%

    line, “Excuse me, may I use the copy machine because I have five pages and I need

    this.  As they try to blend with the people in a specific building and march around
    as if they own the place, other people would think that they truly belong there.        
    In the same way, a social engineer who uses the word “because” is likely to convey
    to the target that they have a legitimate reason.  Most people are likely to cooperate
    when they are given a perception of a reason, regardless if such reason is sensible
    or not.

    right away just to end the day and rest.  Social engineers scout for targets who
    may seem stressed out as they know these people are likely to lose their awareness

    provided with a clear path of what their goals are.  Social engineers want their
    target to act regardless if the action is as simple as replying to their questions
    or as elaborate as accessing a specific restricted area.  In order to get their
    target to act in accordance to their intention, social engineers are inclined
    to asking several questions or simply keep a conversation, which would stimulate
    their target to the path that they are leading.
  prefs: []

- en: The key to effective elicitation is information.  The more social engineers
    are able to gather information, the more successful their ploy would be.  Given
    that elicitation is low risk, it does not pose a threat to targets.  For instance,
    people have numerous conversations with others at coffee shops, stores, or elsewhere
    regardless if they are significant or meaningless.  Thus, the entire concept of
    keeping a conversation is immersed in elicitation, utilizing it in an inauspicious
    manner.  This is why keeping a conversation is significant in elicitation.

    information and use it to stimulate targets to a path in which social engineers
    lead them.  This is why people should be able to discern between a “normal” conversation
    and elicitation as it can be difficult to differentiate.

    They have become proficient in the three main steps of conversing with their targets.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first step is being natural.  Social engineers can create and keep a conversation
    by being natural in the way they speak and act while dealing with their targets. 
    For instance, they are able to have a conversation with their target about something
    they are experts with.  As such, they are able to stand comfortably and convey
    their knowledge without spilling out a hint of malice to their target.  Social
    engineers exude naturalness and confidence.  Not only have they mastered the way
    they speak, but also the nonverbal factors of a conversation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The second step is education.  Social engineers are equipped with knowledge
    about what they are talking about to their targets.  They avoid pretending more
    than they can be believed that they are.  This means that if they want to obtain
    information, say, from a marketing company and their target is an advanced marketer,
    their elicitation approach should involve something about what interests the target. 
    Social engineers research, practice, and prepare before choosing to converse with
    their target.  They come in with adequate knowledge so that they can speak about
    a specific topic intelligently.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The third and final step is not being greedy.  This step may be contradicting
    the motives of social engineers.  However, the objective in creating and keeping
    a conversation is to obtain information, get answers, and be provided the key
    to the target's arena.  As such, when conversing with their targets, social engineers
    avoid being greedy with information.  Instead, they apply the concept of reciprocation,
    making the conversation a give and take process rather than a one-way street. 
    They also allow their targets to dominate the conversation.  Even if the conversation
    leads them to obtaining few information, social engineers are patient enough not
    to be greedy by going deeper and raising a red flag on the part of their targets.

    (DHS) has developed an internal pamphlet on elicitation.  It is a brochure containing
    some significant pointers on how to identify the difference between a normal conversation
    and elicitation.  It also contains measures on how their agents can avoid elicitation.

    job must be important... that is why others think very highly of you.”  The target
    then replies, “Thank you, buy my job is not that important.  All I do is...” 
    This avoidance technique into a possible elicitation is simple yet effective although
    it generally appeals to the target's ego.

    has been indulging with the idea of an additional reporting engine to the system.”

    as an important elicitation aspect.  This is a tactic that is more powerful and
    effective than appealing to the target's ego.  This is because when there is mutual
    interest, the relationship is extended beyond the initial attempt to converse. 
    In this scenario, the social engineer was able to make the target agree to further
    contact by acknowledging the offer of the attacker and expressing interest in
    the plans discussed for the company's system in the future.  This alone can lead
    into a huge system breach.

    the target respond with real facts.  More often than not, people are likely to
    correct a wrong information or statement once they hear them.  It is as if they
    are being challenged to prove otherwise.  It is inherent in people to appear knowledgeable,
    inform others, and be unwilling to tolerate misstatements.  Most social engineers
    know this and use it to bring out real facts from their targets.

- en: The DHS pamphlet also has a scenario wherein the attacker volunteers information. 
    Once a social engineer is able to offer information into a conversation with the
    target, the latter becomes compelled to provide an equally valuable data.  People
    are likely to share similar views, information, or news. Social engineers use
    this fact to set the mood or tone of the conversation while instilling a sense
    of obligation to their target.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another manipulation tool that is discussed in the DHS pamphlet is assumed knowledge. 
    When people assume that someone is knowledgeable in a particular topic or situation,
    it is alright to discuss it with them.  Social engineers are able to exploit this
    human trait deliberately by appearing to be knowledgeable in a topic, then using
    elicitation to establish a conversation.  Social engineers are good in producing
    information, which is as if they own such information and continue to build around
    it to keep a conversation.

    other details that social engineers may find valuable.

    year?” it will be answered with “Algebra.”  Then, the narrow question may already
    be followed up with broader questions to get the teenager to talk more.

    question.  While it may be the complete opposite of open-ended questions, it is
    likewise efficient in leading targets where the social engineer wants them to
    be.
  prefs: []

    information instead of leading the target to the social engineer's goal.  For
    instance, in an open-ended question, the social engineer might ask, “What relationship
    do you have with your manager?”  In a closed-ended question, on the other hand,
    the social engineer asks, “Is your relationship with your manager good?”  This
    type of questioning is obtaining direct yet detailed responses from the target.

    at around 6:30am, you were at the XYZ restaurant, weren't you, Mr. Phoenix?” 
    In this line of questioning, the lawyer leads the witness to where they want to

    social engineers use the emotional or personal attachments to allow them to get
    closer to their targets.  For instance, finding out that every year, the CEO of

    likely to increase their chances of success in pretexting when they use their
    own personal interests.  This may seem a simple tactic, but it can definitely
    convince targets that social engineers are credible.  Trust and rapport are immediately
    ruined if a social engineer claims to be someone who is knowledgeable about a
    specific topic and then comes short of information.  For instance, if a social
    engineer posing as a tech support person has never seen a server room, yet continues
    to play the part can lead to ultimate failure.  This is why most social engineers
    only include activities and topics in their pretexts that they are interested
    in.  This provides them enough room to talk and display their intelligence and
    confidence to their targets.  When social engineers exude with confidence, it
    is easier for them to convince their target that they are what they say.

    instance, if the target asks something or makes a statement, requiring the social
    engineer to think, the latter is likely to pause and start thinking deeply if
    he or she cannot reply with an intelligent answer.  Naturally, people think prior

    goals as well as the indicators that they would achieve what they want.  Once
    social engineers have set clear goals, they would be able to determine that path
    that they need to take to carry out their ploy.  Having goals that are clearly

    may be little things, they can eventually lead to great results in terms of building
    a sense of reciprocation on the part of the targets.

    are hard to obtain, rare, or scarce.  People are likely to be attracted to messages
    in radio, television, and newspapers ads such as “3-Day Sale,” “Limited Time Only,”
    “Going Out of Business Forever,” and “Last Day.”  Generally, these messages lure      
    people to get a share of items, products, or opportunities, which may no longer
    be available.  In the context of sales, using scarcity is widely known with catch
    phrases such as “first 100 callers are entitled to a free widget” or “act now
    while supplies last.”

    of urgency when it comes to decision-making on the part of the target.  Such urgency
    often allows social engineers to manipulate the decision-making as well as control
    the information they give to the target.  Social engineers usually use a combination
    of the principles of scarcity and authority.

    of a chief executive officer (CEO).  The social engineer would claim that the
    CEO called him prior to leaving for the long weekend to fix an email problem. 
    In addition, the social engineer tells the assistant that the CEO claimed of being
    sick and tired of the crashes and wanted the problem fixed by Monday.  In this
    case, the social engineer creates a sense of urgency on the part of the target
    given that the CEO is unavailable.  Furthermore, the scarce item is time given
    that the problem should be dealt before the CEO returns for work.  Thus, scarcity
    establishes a desire, which leads a target to make a decision at once.

    by recommendations or directions given by that individual.  For instance, children
    are instructed to obey their parents, teachers, nannies, and counselors among
    others because these people have authority over them.  Furthermore, children are
    also taught that questioning or disobeying authority is disrespectful and that
    they will be rewarded for their obedience.  These principles are carried over
    into adulthood.  This is why people respect and avoid questioning orders and rules
    by authority figures.

    into the hands of molesters and abusers.  While the cause of molestation and abuse
    is not solely based on this principle, individuals who victimize children know
    that the latter are taught about authority.  In the same way, social engineers
    make use of the principle of authority to carry out their ploys by manipulating
    their targets to take action, leading to a breach.

    consistency of others.  In general, people want congruency and consistency in
    words, deeds, and attitudes both of themselves and others.  The need for reprocessing
    information and making complex decisions are reduced through having consistency.

- en: Social engineers make use of consistency and commitment as powerful tools for
    carrying out their ploys.  Once they establish a form of communication with their
    targets, they commit themselves entirely until they accomplish their goals.  When
    social engineers sense that their targets are using gut feelings in making a decision,
    they work doubly hard using commitment and consistency.  This is to discard any
    uncertainty that their targets might sense in them.

- en: In general, when people like an individual, it is because that individual likes
    them, too.  In the context of social engineering, liking is an extremely useful
    tool.  One of the important attributes that social engineers should have is being
    likeable.  In addition, as social engineers need to gain the trust of their targets,
    they appear to be interested in people in a genuine manner.  For instance, in
    pretexting, social engineers become the individual that they are pretexting more
    than just playing out a belief or an idea.  This makes it easier for them to be
    likable as their targets would conceive that they are genuinely interested in
    liking, assisting, or helping the targets.

- en: Social proof or consensus is referred to as a psychological state wherein people
    are ineffective in discerning the proper mode of behavior in social situations. 
    When people are talking or acting in a certain way, it is safe to assume that
    their behavior is appropriate.  Generally, social influence can result in conformity
    of large groups of people regardless if the choices are correct or misguided. 
    For instance, people who are in an unfamiliar situation, especially if they do
    not have a reference on how to act in the situation, tend to look for the behavior
    of others whom they know are already familiar and better informed of the situation. 
    Furthermore, they mirror the behavior of those people with the assumption that
    it is the appropriate way to act.

- en: In the context of social engineering, social proof is yet another powerful tool. 
    Social engineers use social proof to provoke the compliance of their targets with
    a request through informing them that other individuals also took the same behavior
    or action.  More often than not, social engineers refer to role models or prominent
    individuals in order to get their targets to do what they want.

- en: Social engineers use social proof, especially when there is uncertainty and
    similarity in a specific situation.  For instance, social engineers know when
    the targets are unsure due to an evasive situation because the targets tend to
    observe how others behave and assume such behavior as appropriate.  Social engineers
    also know when the targets tend to mirror or follow the behavior of others in
    a specific situation.  These conditions make it easier for social engineers to
    use social proof.  They will appear to be more convincing when they tell their
    targets that many people before them have done the same action.

    the ability to stimulate and motivate people to act according to their objective.
