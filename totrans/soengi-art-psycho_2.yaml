- en: Social engineering involves basic psychological tactics that attackers employ
    for gaining the trust of their targets as well as getting what they want.  It
    is necessary that you know the social engineering underlying principles so that
    it could be easier to recognize when you are being targeted by an attacker.

  zh: 社会工程涉及攻击者采用的基本心理策略，以获得目标的信任和获取他们想要的东西。了解社会工程的基本原理是必要的，这样在成为攻击目标时更容易识别。
- en: A social engineer exudes control and confidence.  Naturally, people who are
    into carrying out something misleading or deceptive act confidently and in control. 
    For instance, a social engineer may try to pose as an individual from a service
    company or even forge a badge just to gain access in a secure building.  The social
    engineer simply needs to act as if they belong there.  Thus, as a social engineer
    conveys control and confidence, they are able to put others in the building at
    ease.

  zh: 社会工程师散发出控制和自信。自然而然，那些试图进行欺骗或欺诈行为的人会自信并控制局面。例如，社会工程师可能会试图假扮成服务公司的员工，甚至伪造徽章只是为了进入安全建筑物。社会工程师只需要表现得好像他们属于那里。因此，作为社会工程师传递出控制和自信，他们能够使建筑物中的其他人感到安心。
- en: Take the case of the security people in concerts.  The security people do not
    look for badges when they allow people to enter inside a venue.  They look for
    unusual postures.  For instance, security people can determine whether a fan is
    sneaking back to have a glimpse of the star.  They also know the people who are
    working for the event.

  zh: 以音乐会上的安保人员为例。安保人员允许人们进入场馆时并不查看徽章。他们会寻找不寻常的姿势。例如，安保人员可以确定一个粉丝是否潜回去一睹明星的风采。他们还了解参与活动的人员。
- en: A social engineer may also strike up a conversation in order to gain the upper
    hand.  Consequently, when they are able to ask questions to the target, they are
    able to control the conversation.  More often than not, social engineers start
    a conversation with a question, which can put the target immediately on the defense. 
    Thus, the target feels a social pressure to provide an appropriate or correct
    response.

  zh: 社会工程师也可能开始一场对话，以占据优势。因此，当他们能够向目标提出问题时，他们就能控制对话。往往，社会工程师会以问题开始对话，这可能立即使目标处于防御状态。因此，目标感受到社会压力，需要提供适当或正确的回应。
- en: In the event that someone conveys control and confidence both offline and online,
    the key is not to become too comfortable.  For instance, companies should advise
    employees to be keen when it comes to allowing outsides enter the building.  Guests
    and even service providers should be checked thoroughly for credentials regardless
    if their faces may be familiar.

  zh: 在某人既在线上又离线上表现出控制和自信时，关键是不要变得太放松。例如，公司应建议员工在允许外部人员进入建筑物时保持警惕。无论他们的面孔是否熟悉，都应对客人甚至服务提供者进行认真检查。
- en: A social engineer offer favors or free gifts. One of the human impulses that
    social engineers use is reciprocation.  More often than not, when people are given
    gifts or favors, they feel the need to give in return whether or not they like
    the person giving something to them.  A social engineer may offer to hold the
    door for an individual who belongs in a company or offer cookies to a receptionist
    to gain access to the building.

  zh: 社会工程师提供好处或免费礼物。 社会工程师利用的一个人类冲动是回报。往往，当人们收到礼物或好处时，无论他们是否喜欢给予者，他们都觉得有必要回报。社会工程师可能会提出为公司成员开门或向接待员提供饼干以进入建筑物。
- en: Most social engineers know that the time delay between offering a gift and asking
    for a favor is crucial.  This is because the target might take the gift as a bribe
    when the social engineer immediately asks for a favor.  The target is likely to
    act uncomfortably when they perceive the gift as a bribe.  As such, a social engineer
    is inclined to giving a gift, say, to a guard or receptionist of a building in
    the morning and come back in the afternoon.  The social engineer may claim a mix-up,
    such as pretending that there was a confusion with an item or than an item was
    left in one of the rooms of the building after a meeting.  The guard or receptionist
    is likely to let the social engineer enter the building as an act of reciprocation
    for the latter's gift.

  zh: 大多数社会工程师知道，提供礼物并要求帮忙之间的时间延迟至关重要。这是因为目标可能会把礼物视为贿赂，当社会工程师立即请求帮忙时。当目标认为礼物是贿赂时，目标很可能会感到不舒服。因此，社会工程师倾向于在早上给保安或前台送礼物，然后在下午再回来。社会工程师可能会声称出现了混乱，比如假装在会议后遗忘了一个物品或者说物品遗留在建筑物的某个房间。作为对后者礼物的回报，保安或前台很可能会允许社会工程师进入建筑物。
- en: To prevent something like this from happening, employees should be skeptical,
    specifically when someone is trying to offer them a gift.  In most cases, social
    engineers spend weeks in order to lay the foundation to establish a reciprocal
    relationship with their targets, leading them to access to secure or sensitive
    areas.

  zh: 为了防止类似事件的发生，员工应该持怀疑态度，特别是当有人试图给他们送礼物时。在大多数情况下，社会工程师会花费数周时间来奠定与目标的互惠关系基础，使他们能够进入安全或敏感区域。
- en: A social engineer makes use of humor.  In general, people enjoy the company
    of other individuals with a good sense of humor.  This fact does not escape the
    knowledge of most social engineers.  They know that they can use humor to gain
    information, get out of trouble, or win over a gatekeeper.  For instance, a social
    engineer may simply convey an upbeat impression to a security guard questioning
    them.  Social engineers usually give their targets the impression that they are
    not worried with the questioning.

  zh: 社会工程师善于利用幽默。一般来说，人们喜欢和幽默感强的人在一起。大多数社会工程师都知道这个事实。他们知道他们可以利用幽默来获取信息、摆脱麻烦或者说服门卫。例如，一个社会工程师可能只是向质疑他们的保安传达一个乐观的印象。社会工程师通常给他们的目标人群的印象是他们对质疑并不担忧。
- en: In addition, social engineers may try to strike up a conversation in order to
    obtain information from their target.  For instance, a social engineer may pose
    as an IT person and fake a call, asking for the target's password.  The social
    engineer may use humor during the call as the target is likely to volunteer sensitive
    information when the conversation is comfortable and fun.

  zh: 此外，社会工程师可能会试图开始一场对话，以从目标那里获取信息。例如，一个社会工程师可能会冒充IT人员并伪造一个电话，询问目标的密码。在电话中，社会工程师可能会利用幽默，因为在对话轻松有趣时，目标很可能会自愿提供敏感信息。
- en: 'A social engineer always states a reason. A recent study was conducted involving
    2 groups of participants.  The first group was waiting in line to use a library''s
    copy machine.  The second group was tasked to cut the line so they can use the
    machine first.  The study found out that people are inclined to concede to individuals
    when they hear the work “because.”  In the said study, the second group cut in
    line to use a copy machine saying the following: “Excuse me, may I use the copy
    machine because I have five pages and I am in a hurry?”  This statement made 94%
    of the first group concede, allowing the individual to skip the line.'

  zh: 社会工程师总是说明原因。最近进行了一项涉及两组参与者的研究。第一组正在排队使用图书馆的复印机。第二组的任务是插队以便他们可以第一个使用机器。研究发现，当人们听到“因为”这个词时，他们往往倾向于让步给个人。在这项研究中，第二组插队使用复印机，说的是：“对不起，我可以使用复印机吗？因为我有五页资料而且很着急。”
    这个陈述让第一组的94%让步，允许个人跳过队伍。
- en: In another scenario, an individual in the second group used the line, “Excuse
    me, may I use the copy machine?  I have five pages.”  This statement made 60%
    of the first group concede.  In the final scenario, the second group used the
    line, “Excuse me, may I use the copy machine because I have five pages and I need
    to have copies?”  While the reason may be absurd, 93% of the first group allowed
    the line-cutter.

    尽管理由可能荒谬，但93%的第一组允许了插队者。
- en: Consequently, the magic word in the study was “because.”  Social engineers know
    this.  As they try to blend with the people in a specific building and march around
    as if they own the place, other people would think that they truly belong there.        
    In the same way, a social engineer who uses the word “because” is likely to convey
    to the target that they have a legitimate reason.  Most people are likely to cooperate
    when they are given a perception of a reason, regardless if such reason is sensible
    or not.

  zh: 因此，研究中的魔法词是“因为”。社会工程师知道这一点。当他们试图与特定建筑物中的人混为一体，并像自己拥有这个地方一样四处走动时，其他人会认为他们真的属于那里。同样，使用“因为”这个词的社会工程师很可能向目标传达他们有一个合理的理由。大多数人在被给予一个理由的感知时很可能会合作，无论这个理由是否合理。
- en: Given that social engineers can work in any type of environment, people should
    take time to know what is going on around them and what is being said to them. 
    More often than not, people who have a hectic day are likely to give up information
    right away just to end the day and rest.  Social engineers scout for targets who
    may seem stressed out as they know these people are likely to lose their awareness
    as well as presence of mind.

  zh: 鉴于社会工程师可以在任何环境中工作，人们应该花时间了解周围发生的事情以及对他们说了什么。往往，那些度过忙碌一天的人很可能立即放弃信息，只是为了结束一天并休息。社会工程师寻找看起来压力山大的目标，因为他们知道这些人很可能失去警觉和头脑的存在。

- en: Most governments warn and educate their employees about elicitation given that
    this psychological variable is used by spies across the globe.  For instance,
    the National Security Agency of the United States government has defined elicitation
    in its training materials as “the subtle extraction of information during an apparently
    normal and innocent conversation.”  The conversations referred in this definition
    can transpire anywhere, such as in a daycare, a restaurant, the gym, or just about
    any place where the target is.

    这个定义中提到的对话可以发生在任何地方，比如托儿所、餐厅、健身房，或者任何目标所在的地方。
- en: Given that elicitation is low risk and extremely difficult to detect, it works
    well with other aspects of social engineering.  More often than not, targets never

- en: The key to effective elicitation is information.  The more social engineers
    are able to gather information, the more successful their ploy would be.  Given
    that elicitation is low risk, it does not pose a threat to targets.  For instance,
    people have numerous conversations with others at coffee shops, stores, or elsewhere
    regardless if they are significant or meaningless.  Thus, the entire concept of
    keeping a conversation is immersed in elicitation, utilizing it in an inauspicious
    manner.  This is why keeping a conversation is significant in elicitation.

    因此，保持对话的整个概念都沉浸在引诱中，并将其以不吉利的方式利用。 这就是为什么保持对话在引诱中非常重要。

    by being natural in the way they speak and act while dealing with their targets. 
    For instance, they are able to have a conversation with their target about something
    they are experts with.  As such, they are able to stand comfortably and convey
    their knowledge without spilling out a hint of malice to their target.  Social
    engineers exude naturalness and confidence.  Not only have they mastered the way
    they speak, but also the nonverbal factors of a conversation.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 第一步是自然。社会工程师可以通过自然的方式在与他们的目标打交道时说话和行动来创建和保持对话。例如，他们能够与他们的目标就他们擅长的某些事情进行对话。因此，他们能够轻松地站着，向目标传达他们的知识，而不向目标透露任何恶意的暗示。社会工程师散发着自然和自信。他们不仅掌握了说话的方式，还掌握了对话的非言语因素。
- en: The second step is education.  Social engineers are equipped with knowledge
    about what they are talking about to their targets.  They avoid pretending more
    than they can be believed that they are.  This means that if they want to obtain
    information, say, from a marketing company and their target is an advanced marketer,
    their elicitation approach should involve something about what interests the target. 
    Social engineers research, practice, and prepare before choosing to converse with
    their target.  They come in with adequate knowledge so that they can speak about
    a specific topic intelligently.
  id: totrans-34

  zh: 第二步是教育。社会工程师了解他们与目标交谈的内容。他们避免假装自己比他们被认为是的更聪明。这意味着，如果他们想从一个营销公司获得信息，而他们的目标是一名高级营销人员，他们的引诱方法应涉及到目标感兴趣的内容。社会工程师在选择与他们的目标交谈之前进行研究，练习和准备。他们带着充分的知识来说话，以便能够聪明地谈论一个特定的主题。
- en: The third and final step is not being greedy.  This step may be contradicting
    the motives of social engineers.  However, the objective in creating and keeping
    a conversation is to obtain information, get answers, and be provided the key
    to the target's arena.  As such, when conversing with their targets, social engineers
    avoid being greedy with information.  Instead, they apply the concept of reciprocation,
    making the conversation a give and take process rather than a one-way street. 
    They also allow their targets to dominate the conversation.  Even if the conversation
    leads them to obtaining few information, social engineers are patient enough not
    to be greedy by going deeper and raising a red flag on the part of their targets.

  zh: 第三步也是最后一步就是不贪心。这一步可能与社会工程师的动机相矛盾。然而，创建和保持对话的目标是获取信息，得到答案，并获得进入目标领域的关键。因此，当与他们的目标交谈时，社会工程师避免过多地获取信息。相反，他们应用互惠的概念，使对话成为一种互相给予和接受的过程，而不是单向的。他们还允许他们的目标主导对话。即使对话导致他们获得了少量信息，社会工程师也足够耐心，不会因为过度贪婪而进一步深入，并引起他们目标方面的警惕。

- en: This tactic of the attacker is expressing mutual interest, which is considered
    as an important elicitation aspect.  This is a tactic that is more powerful and
    effective than appealing to the target's ego.  This is because when there is mutual
    interest, the relationship is extended beyond the initial attempt to converse. 
    In this scenario, the social engineer was able to make the target agree to further

    to using an outline over using a script.  When a social engineer makes use of

- en: Spontaneity in pretexts is also associated with using a storyline that the social
    engineer is personally interested in.  Coming in to the target without knowledge
    about the pretext can compromise the credibility of the social engineer.  For
    instance, if the target asks something or makes a statement, requiring the social
    engineer to think, the latter is likely to pause and start thinking deeply if
    he or she cannot reply with an intelligent answer.  Naturally, people think prior

    This is because they know that practice can either make or break their pretext. 
    As mentioned in the previous sections, social engineers who work alone practice

    social engineering, attackers approach a target with a vivid knowledge of their
    goals as well as the indicators that they would achieve what they want.  Once
    social engineers have set clear goals, they would be able to determine that path
    that they need to take to carry out their ploy.  Having goals that are clearly

    attention of the other individual you are targeting.  In addition, you should
    be able to affect his unconscious mind.  Social engineers have advanced skills

    as well as your sensory acuity or surroundings.  When you are observant, you have
    the ability to take note of the signs in the individual that you are targeting,

    return.  Concessions such as this are “risk-free” and especially effective when

    engineers give in a little during their first attempt and another over time so
