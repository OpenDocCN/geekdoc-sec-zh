    information assets and is surprised when the evaluation is estimated to be in
    the range of $4 million, the equivalent of their annual turnover. As a result,
    this receives the full attention of senior management and the business sets about
    hardening its security measures.

    come up with a new and inspirational method of attack, which would enable them
    to covertly get through the strong defenses. This is where they implemented the
    approach of carrying out the assault using social engineering tactics, exploiting
    the weaknesses associated with people. This was the birth of the Trojan horse-style
    attack; whereby an attractive gift is delivered, awaiting a trusted resident to
    transport it, containing a hidden payload, through the various layers of defenses.
    This approach not only has the potential for greater success but also allows the
    perpetrator to launch a strong attack (having avoided being weakened through the
    numerous layers of defense) closer to the heart of the target.

    of Social Engineering appears in abundance throughout the ages. Take a look at
    many stories (both children and adult) that include the use of Social Engineering.
    For instance, the bulk of children’s fairy tales are based upon Social Engineering
    concepts (Hansel and Gretel, Snow White, Red Riding Hood, Pinocchio, etc.) and
    the entire concept of the quintet of Terminator films have been created on the
    concept of Social Engineering, when the machines become self-aware they identify
    the threats perceived from humans and, as part of a vulnerability management program,
    start to wipe them out, through the use of Social Engineering, masquerading machines
    to look like humans.

    to Information Security. For example, with all the aforementioned readily available

    e-mail?

    need to focus on those human vulnerabilities, ensuring that their employees become
    self-aware and include the human element in their vulnerability management program.

    and procedures and contributing to a substantial level of protection, especially
    when supported by a security awareness program that includes Social Engineering.

    the acceptance of unexpected gifts or had the city of Troy residents received
    a security awareness program highlighting the vulnerabilities associated with
    the exploitation of human nature, would the siege have ended in the same manner?
    In truth, it is extremely likely that the end result may have been significantly
    different. For example, what would have been the chances of the residents of the
    city of Troy dragging the large wooden horse through the various layers of defense

    and as a result introduces a number of physical security controls. Following which,
    an external door or window is found unlocked negating these supplementary security
    measures. In response, the company implements a formal cease-work procedure whereby
    the last person to depart the building is required to carry out a physical walk
    around to ensure that no sensitive paperwork is left out and all the doors and
    windows are secured. Following the first few weeks after its introduction, everyone
    is adhering to the new procedure and the benefits of improved security measures
    are clearly evident. Then, as is always the case when dealing with people, complacency
    sets in and personnel start to let things slip. This leads to a window being left
    open once again negating the additional security measures. The management responds
    with a half-hearted reprimand that provides little deterrence and has little effect
    on reducing the chance of a reoccurrence. The relevance and importance of this
    new procedure suffers further damage 1 week later when it becomes known that a
    member of the senior management has been guilty of paying lip service to it and
    leaving the premises insecure.

- en: • **Example 2**. A company makes the conscious decision to ensure that all their
    sensitive data is secured away when not required. As a result, they introduce
    a clear desk policy, which requires all employees to ensure that any sensitive
    data is locked within the secure office furniture. This all sounds like good practice
    to help the business safeguard its sensitive information. However, the policy
    is only ever seen by the author and the approver, being retained in a private
    folder and not being made readily available to all of the company’s employees
    who as part of their duties are responsible for dealing with sensitive information
    assets. Subsequently, during the out of hours, one of the cleaners inadvertently
    picks up a number of these items along with various items of rubbish and it ends
    up at the local landfill site. The potential consequences for such an accident
    is a breach of confidentiality or creating a significant impact to the business
    when this crucial information is not available at the time it is required.

    fluid virtual online environment, and hence it is hard to pin-down the associated
    information security risks. While a variety of information security risks are
    connected with “the Cyberspace”*, many (such as network and system hacking, spyware
    and malware, cross-site scripting, SQL injection, social engineering, plus information
    security issues relating to “Web 2.0,” cloud computing and virtualisation technologies
    that typically underpin virtual online environments and applications) could be
    classed as normal or conventional system, network, and application security risks
    and, in practice, the standard is largely concerned with information security
    risks associated with the Internet, rather than “the Cyberspace” per se. However,
    since these risks are already pretty well covered by other ISO/IEC or ISO/IEC
    information security standards, either published or under development, it is uncertain
    what information security risks are truly unique to “the Cyberspace.” Risks to
    virtual assets belonging players of Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing
    Games (MMORPGs) are mentioned in the standard but not directly addressed, for
    example. Frequent innovation in the realm of “the Cyberspace” makes it especially

    emails, but readers may have noted that this has been identified as an exploitable
    method of verification so how can this be suitable? It all comes down to the balancing
    security versus business benefits. Consequently, the weaknesses of formal processes
    can only be truly identified through appropriate testing and if such a vulnerability
    is identified an additional measure may be required. Such as the application of
    the use of a regularly changed authentication passphrase that is only available
    from an internal location, such as a management restricted area on the companies’
    intranet or a restricted folder on the local area network.

    with people. However, it also demonstrates how the correct application, interpretation
    and adoption of such a Help Desk procedure can help to reduce the chances of being
    subject to a successful Social Engineering attack and to identify a potential
    Social Engineering attack, using this approach.

    a Social Engineering episode and then pondered the question of how this risk could
    have been mitigated through a policy and procedure back in the age of Troy. Two
    more up-to-date examples were then discussed before starting to look at various
    industry security standards such as PCI:DSS and ISO/IEC 27001:2013 and how they
    covered the need for a Social Engineering policy. The chapter finished by providing
    an example template for such a Social Engineering policy that could be written
    for the business after first assessing the risk and understanding the real threat
    of a Social Engineering-based breach to the business.
