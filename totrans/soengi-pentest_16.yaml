    attack. This chapter is going to look at the social engineering report and how
    this can be written to give the most value to the customer. The chapter will cover
    the collection of data during the assessment that is required to formulate the
    report, before moving onto the report itself and making suggestions as to the
    structure and elements that should be included. The last section looks at the
    way the report is delivered and presented to the customer.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is very likely that anyone working in a professional services organization
    will already be well versed in the task of report creation. A customer engages
    a professional services organization in order to perform an assessment such as
    a social engineering assessment. The deliverable of what can be weeks of work
    is usually presented as a written report to the customer. The remainder of this
    chapter will look at the process of gathering and organizing the information required
    in order to create a report to deliver to the client.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is common for a short professional services engagement to run for 5 days.
    Out of these 5 days, it is usual that 3 days will be spent on testing with the
    other 2 days spent on report writing. Therefore, the importance of a report structure
    is paramount to the consultant to ensure that an efficient system is put into
    place to deliver a report that provides maximum value for the customer. As with
    most things, the more experienced a consultant is the better their processes will
    become.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One point of note is the differences between report structures of competing
    professional services companies. The authors of this book have worked for several
    companies and observed differing standards when it comes to providing the customer
    with the deliverable of the project, the report. It is advisable to invest the
    time to produce a quality report template that can be reproduced on a per client
    basis.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There is usually a time period between performing the assessment and writing
    the report. It is important to try to keep this time to a minimum although in
    practice this often includes traveling, performing two or three assessments before
    getting back in the office and ready to write up all three assessments. The nirvana
    would be to perform the assessment Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday and then write
    the report on Thursday and Friday.

    collected and analyzed some meaningful data to put in the report. It is very important
    to find a data collection process that works for each individual.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are many methods for collecting data and it is important for the reader
    to find which method is the best for them. Far too often, people spend too long
    trying to shoehorn a new tool into their workflow rather than concentrating on
    the actual process. It is not the tool that matters but the process of how to
    use the tool efficiently, in order to collect the data into a safe and secure
    format that can be easily interpreted at a later stage when writing the report.

    the collection of notes do not make sense a few days after the end of the assignment.
    This is especially true if there have been multiple assessments performed, as
    occurrences during assessments do have the ability to blend into one, making the
    practice of strict note taking more important than ever.

    to ensure this information is securely stored while on the consultant’s laptop.

    offering social engineering services would be expected to already implement a
    process for ensuring the security of data in transit.

    be investigated. The first is using a simple text editor and a folder structure

    which is a method used considerably by the authors of this book and the third
    is by using a specific document manager such as Scrivener.

    in order to be able to go through it, analyze it, and report on it. This data
    will take the form of a case file. This case file can take the form of one of
    the three examples below or it can take the format of another tool of your choice.
    The most important thing is to ensure that the data is collected in a format that
    can be understood, ready for collating and reporting on, when returning to the
    office.

    not needed may always be excluded, but there is nothing worse than not having
    enough information to formulate a report. Therefore, it is advised to keep a full
    log of what has been done and take as many screenshots and photos as required
    to build this case file.

    and a folder structure within the file system. All operating systems come preloaded
    with at least one text editor. This could be **Notepad** on Windows, **TextEdit**
    on OS X, or **vi** on Linux.

    report. For example, if there were a task of running an assessment that included
    a Remote Telephone Attack, Phishing Email Attack, and an Onsite Physical Attack
    at two locations the structure would look similar to what can be seen at [Figure
    13.1](#F0010).

    make linear notes as progress is being made through the assessment. Any documentary
    evidence such as screenshots, file attachments, or photographs can be added to
    the folder appertaining to that specific part of the assessment as it progresses.'

    a single text file within each folder that acts as like an explanation of how
    the assessment was performed, what actions were taken, what were the results and
    failures along with anything else required for the report. As well as these text
    files, there would also be a collection of files within each folder that makes
    up the documentary evidence for the findings of each part of the assessment.

    Mind Mapping is a way to use both sides of the brain in harmony by utilizing the
    technical left-hand side of the brain together with the more creative right-hand
    side of the brain.

    details, and facts. The right-hand side of the brain is generally fuzzier and
    is dominated by symbols, images, and spatial perception.

    both sides of the brain, to think better. Mind Maps do this by utilizing the left

    assessment, first there needs to be an initial structure. It is highly recommended
    that a single Mind Map per customer assessment be created, using a single core
    branch for each of the main parts of the assessment.

    that can be used for information and notes relating to the assessment and then
    each subsequent core branch reflects a part of the assessment. As an example,
    each core brand has also got subbranch information to provide a feel for the more
    complete structure of the template.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To use the Mind Map, as a data collection tool, it is important to start to
    take text notes, as progress is made through the assessment. However, rather than
    storing these in a linear format, try making them in the appropriate branch of
    the Mind Map. Most Mind Map editors have the ability to create text notes and
    link to these from the branch so that they can be viewed within the application
    or printed out for reference. As well as using text notes within the Mind Map
    links to file attachments and place images and photos can be made, directly onto
    the Mind Map.

    data collected using a chosen method of data collection. This data is used to
    formulate and write a structured report that provides value to the end user and
    forms the final deliverable of the consultancy work that the company was engaged
    within. The next stage of concern is the delivery of the report to the customer.

    to the client. It is presumed that anyone working for a company, engaged in such
    professional services, will have a corporate standard for secure document delivery
    in place. This may be using a secure customer portal where the customer authenticates
    against an encrypted secure portal and then securely downloads the report or through
    the use of an email encryption scheme, where the email is encrypted and securely
    delivered to the customer.

    some questions to ask the consultant, who performed the assessment. This debrief

    write the document. The next step was to look at how to write the report and a
    simple professional services consultancy report template was suggested that covered
    the necessary elements for a social engineering report. The final section in this
    chapter covered the delivery report and how care has to be taken to ensure the
    data confidentiality and integrity of the report along with a suggested client
    debrief once the customer has digested the information contained within the report.
