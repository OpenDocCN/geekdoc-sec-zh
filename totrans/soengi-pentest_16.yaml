    this can be written to give the most value to the customer. The chapter will cover
    the collection of data during the assessment that is required to formulate the

    will already be well versed in the task of report creation. A customer engages
    a professional services organization in order to perform an assessment such as
    a social engineering assessment. The deliverable of what can be weeks of work
    is usually presented as a written report to the customer. The remainder of this
    chapter will look at the process of gathering and organizing the information required
    in order to create a report to deliver to the client.

    Out of these 5 days, it is usual that 3 days will be spent on testing with the
    other 2 days spent on report writing. Therefore, the importance of a report structure
    is paramount to the consultant to ensure that an efficient system is put into
    place to deliver a report that provides maximum value for the customer. As with
    most things, the more experienced a consultant is the better their processes will
    become.

    professional services companies. The authors of this book have worked for several
    companies and observed differing standards when it comes to providing the customer

    time to produce a quality report template that can be reproduced on a per client

    the report. It is important to try to keep this time to a minimum although in
    practice this often includes traveling, performing two or three assessments before
    getting back in the office and ready to write up all three assessments. The nirvana
    would be to perform the assessment Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday and then write
    the report on Thursday and Friday.

    take text notes, as progress is made through the assessment. However, rather than
    storing these in a linear format, try making them in the appropriate branch of
    the Mind Map. Most Mind Map editors have the ability to create text notes and
    link to these from the branch so that they can be viewed within the application
    or printed out for reference. As well as using text notes within the Mind Map
    links to file attachments and place images and photos can be made, directly onto
    the Mind Map.
