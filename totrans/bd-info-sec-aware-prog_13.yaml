- en: Many items factor into the training cycle for an organization such as budget,
    management support, regulatory compliance, and amount of material. If your organization
    must perform training activities to satisfy regulatory compliance, use this to
    deliver meaningful training material, as opposed to the absolute minimum required.
    Determining or adjusting the training cycle for your organization depends not
    only on the security division but also on the support of the management. Work
    closely with the senior management as you plan your training; they will provide
    guidance in terms of budget, training frequency, and methods. Effective information
    security programs have the support of the senior management, and in the long term,
    it's better to deliver a scaled back program that has the support of the senior
    management and then spend all of your time struggling with the people whose support
    you need.

- en: In order for employees to retain knowledge, they'll need to be trained more
    than once. True education is not a one-shot process. A training cycle should consist
    of short- and long-term training instances. In this chapter, we'll discuss various
    options for creating your own training cycle. While reviewing the options, keep
    in mind that you don't need to implement all of them, just what makes sense for
    your organization.

    This also applies to awareness training. New hire training is an employee's first
    glimpse into the inner workings of the organization. If security training is disorganized
    or incomplete, it can convey that security isn't a priority for the organization
    or its employees. At a minimum training should

    Although new hire training is essential, in order for employees to retain the
    concepts long-term, they require periodic refreshers.

- en: Many industry standards require quarterly security awareness training. If your
    organization is required to comply with these regulations, use it to your advantage.
    Quarterly training is a fantastic opportunity to update employees on the latest
    threats and trends. Was the organization targeted with a phishing e-mail? If so,
    include the message in the training and highlight the suspicious portions. Don't
    forget to include the procedure for reporting suspicious e-mails.

    be considered the minimum required time frame. Expecting employees to remember
    something after being taught one time will leave your employees unprepared and
    frustrated. If training can only occur twice a year, ensure that the content is
    focused on critical topics to your organization's security. While every organization's
    priorities are different, a few examples are

- en: Point of failure, also known as embedded training, refers to training administered
    when an employee fails a simulated phishing attack. There are mixed opinions of
    the effectiveness of point-of-failure training in the industry. Some industry
    members claim this method of training is ineffective [[3](#bb0020)] because employees
    aren't retaining the information presented. Other industry members claim this
    method of training is extremely effective [[4](#bb0025)] if implemented properly.
    If your management does not support quarterly training for everyone, point-of-failure
    training can educate employees that need it the most.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The key to properly implementing point-of-failure training is frequency of testing.
    Employees who failed a simulated attack should be tested again within weeks of
    the failure. This process reinforces the presented material by requiring them
    to apply learned concepts. However, the simulated phishing attack should not look
    identical to the failed attack. In [Chapter 11](B9780124199675000119.xhtml), we'll
    discuss creating your own simulated phishing attacks.

- en: Training by department should be included in the annual training cycle. For
    maximum effectiveness, present this training separately from the general employee
    training. Presenting the material separately enables the employees to absorb and
    retain the information long term. Ideally, this targeted training should be conducted
    quarterly and should focus on no more than three key messages or threats that
    are unique to each department. Highlight the unique threats facing each organization.
    Accounts receivable and marketing are at a high risk for macro viruses and malicious
    PDF documents, because opening documents received from outside the organization
    is a common activity. The help desk is a prime target for attackers to gain information
    about computer accounts, corporate policies, operating system details, and organizational
    structure via fake phone calls to the help desk. Create a list of top threats
    for each department, and then create training segments that address no more than
    three specific threats.

- en: If you have an existing training cycle in place and metrics indicate that training
    isn't meeting the targeted goal, it is likely the training cycle requires adjusting.
    Increasing continual training is a low-cost option. Combining new continual training
    with additional training type will yield a higher return on investment. Use the
    metrics to determine which areas of awareness are below average and adjust the
    training cycle to increase training in those areas. For instance, if phishing
    detection results were low, consider implementing point-of-failure training to
    provide instant training for employees who did not pass the phishing assessment.
    Program metrics are discussed at length in [Chapter 13](B9780124199675000132.xhtml).
