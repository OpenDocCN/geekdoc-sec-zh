    guards come to mind. While those are components, there are many other elements
    that create a physical security program. In this chapter, we'll discuss building
    security, data center security, physical security assessments, and what physical
    security means to the employee.

- en: 'Physical security describes security measures that are designed to control
    access to a building, facility, or resource from unauthorized personnel. Unauthorized
    personnel include attackers who wish to cause harm to the protected environment
    and accidental intruders, such as employees who may not be aware of the restricted
    area [[1](#bb0010)]. Physical security can be divided into three basic levels:
    outer perimeter security, inner perimeter security, and interior security.'

    includes one building; for others, it is a campus of multiple buildings and parking
    facilities. The goal of securing the outer perimeter is to control who can walk

- en: An organization can have a multimillion-dollar cyber security program with the
    latest technology and specialized staff, but if an attacker can simply walk into
    their building and obtain network access, the security implementation is flawed.
    As mentioned in [Chapter 7](B9780124199675000077.xhtml), physical security breaches
    and social engineering go hand in hand. Employee awareness of physical security
    is crucial to the success of protecting the organization's information and employee
    safety. In order to properly educate your employees on physical attacks, we've
    detailed the typical steps that a Red Team, or physical assessment team, would
    follow to obtain unauthorized access to a building or campus.

    unauthorized, wouldn't you want to have as much information as possible before
    the attack? It is most likely that the assessment team is not physically located
    within close proximity of the target facility. Most organizations will not fund
    several weeks of travel for an assessment team to perform reconnaissance, thus
    creating the need for off-site and on-site reconnaissance.

    the physical assessment world. A target's surrounding area plays a large role
    in the assessment dynamics. One of the most important goals of the off-site reconnaissance
    phase is to locate potential on-site reconnaissance areas. If the target is located
    in a heavily populated area surrounded by office buildings, coffee shops, and
    restaurants, the assessment team will have many on-site reconnaissance areas.
    However, if the target is located in a rural area, on-site reconnaissance options
    may be extremely limited. In some heavily populated areas, you may be able to
    view your target area near real time by utilizing Internet traffic and weather
    cameras ([Figure 8.3](#f0020)). Google Maps provide a web camera option for select
    locations.

    exterior of the building to attract potential clients. These photos are analyzed
    for information similar to photos from the company website. Additionally, it may
    be possible to determine if the target organization leases the entire building
    or portions of it. A quick phone call to the real estate agent can confirm building
    availability. Assessment team members often approach real estate companies as
    a fictitious business that is interested in leasing space in the target building

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Many organizations utilize RFID access systems to prevent unauthorized entry
    into their facilities. These access systems rely on ID cards and card readers
    to verify a person's access level. Most ID cards are proximity-based. When the
    ID card is held up to the reader, it receives power from the reader in order to
    verify its contents. Door controllers and servers then determine if the presented
    credentials are permitted into the secured area. Reading and reproducing the contents
    of the ID card can compromise some RFID access card systems. The two popular devices
    for RFID credential capture are the Proxmark3 and the Bishop Fox Long-range RFID
    Stealer. These devices can read and store the contents of RFID cards that are
    within read range. The two main challenges with these devices are getting close
    enough to the target person without raising suspicion and transporting the necessary
    power and antenna hardware. Some designs include attaching the hardware to the
    inside of a binder using Velcro. At first glance, the binder appears unmodified.
    However, compartments conceal the Proxmark3, power supply, and antenna ([Figures

    6 in. of a person's ID card is fairly difficult, even in highly populated areas.
    To solve this problem, employees at Bishop Fox created a Long-range RFID Stealer
    [[4](#bb0025)]. The design utilizes a long-range RFID card reader, as shown in
    [Figure 8.8](#f0045).

    the LCD, and then writes the card contents to a microSD card for analysis on a
    computer. The assessment team utilizes RFID credential stealing technology during
    on-site reconnaissance to collect ID card information. Once the card information
    is collected and analyzed, the team will write the appropriate electronic content
    to an ID card. Finally, the team members will create a fictitious ID card printout,
    including the team member's picture; attach it to the programmed ID card; and
    laminate the finished product. This process produces an ID card that will most
    likely pass basic visual inspection and access control systems.

    The most popular method for assessing your organization's risk of physical attack
    is to perform a physical security assessment, or physical penetration test. Typically
