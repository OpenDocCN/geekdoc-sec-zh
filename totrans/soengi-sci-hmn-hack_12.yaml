    a few people start a successful business by generating some buzz in the community
    even though they had no previous experience in social engineering. They came to
    DEF CON and entered the Social Engineering Capture The Flag (SECTF) contests I
    host there. After doing really well and winning, they went on to create successful
    companies that provide social engineering services. Building credibility helped
    them along their path.  ### Get Hired by a Pentest Company'

    and motivation to “solve” their problems. The people feel needed, wanted, and
    accepted. The new tribe asks for small things at first, building trust and a close
    bond. This continues until the conversion is complete.

    predators to groom children. Using online chatting tools, predators start a relationship

    listen, use open-ended questions, and suggest ideas and concepts that eventually
