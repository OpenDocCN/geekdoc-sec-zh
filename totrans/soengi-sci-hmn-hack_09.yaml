    other people.

    an involuntary reaction, and that reaction is displayed by microexpressions. In
    addition, when we make facial expressions, we create the emotion attached to that
    expression.

    advantage of their empathetic response.

    anger, fear, surprise, disgust, contempt, sadness, or happiness. The emotion that

    R. S. Minvaleev, A. D. Nozdrachev, V. V. Kir'yanova and A. I. Ivanov. ([https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/B:HUMP.0000036341.80214.28](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/B:HUMP.0000036341.80214.28)).

    with confident behaviors, a person's testosterone increased by more than 16% and
    their cortisol dropped by 11%. Coincidentally, testosterone is known to increase
    behaviors that would be associated with a confident person. So, almost as a self-fulfilling

    you feel and act more confident.

    is that not only does having an emotion trigger a nonverbal response, but if you
    were to force the nonverbal on yourself, you can trigger the emotion. This concept
    was backed up by numerous researchers, including in a study titled “Inhibiting
    and Facilitating Conditions of the Human Smile: A Nonobtrusive Test of the Facial
    Feedback Hypothesis” (`[www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3379579](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3379579)`).
    Researchers Strack, Martin, and Stepper tested Dr. Ekman''s hypothesis from the
    1970s and 1980s and were able to show that if you create the expression, you can
    trigger the emotion. They did this by asking subjects to put a pen in their mouth
    to trigger muscular usage that simulated a smile. They were able to prove the
    same thing that Dr. Ekman stated in his research: Creating the facial expression
    (even by force) creates the emotion associated with it.'

    the way up to exhibiting violent behavior.

    Muscles tense, the jaw tightens, and the person might clench their fists—all in
    a preparation for a fight or defense. As the person gets closer to taking a violent
    action, you might even see their chin lower in a protective measure to protect
    the neck.

    anger try to make themselves larger. For example, an angry person might expand

    In a study conducted by Jorge A. Barraza and Paul J. Zak titled “Empathy towards
    Strangers Triggers Oxytocin Release and Subsequent Generosity,” (`[https://nyaspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.04504.x](https://nyaspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.04504.x)`),
    the researchers showed that there was a 47% increase in oxytocin release when
    empathy was triggered, even when the empathetic feeling was between complete strangers,
    whereas sadness can create a lack of serotonin, dopamine, and oxytocin in the
    brain. As a professional, I try to stick to the empathy side of sadness instead
    of the worry, grief, or depression side of the spectrum.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Happiness is one emotion that we can all agree is very useful to all human interactions.
    When we feel happy, content, at peace, or relaxed, we are more prone to make more
    altruistic decisions. We tend to like the people, places, or things that make
    us feel this emotion.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For that reason, it is easy to see that, as a social engineer, happiness would
    be one emotion you want to master reading and eliciting. The first thing that
    can really help you to see if you are doing a good job and creating happiness
    is learning to identify the difference between a real smile and a fake smile.
    The one thing that separates a real smile from a fake smile is the activation
    of the orbicularis oculi muscle. When triggered, this muscle raises your cheeks
    and forms what we call “crow's feet” around the eyes.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the mid-1800s, a French researcher named Guillaume Duchenne postulated that
    a real smile could be faked. He was studying neuroscience with the use of a very
    invasive form of electroshock. He administered shocks to stimulate muscle movement
    (`[www.thevintagenews.com/2016/05/07/44782-2](http://www.thevintagenews.com/2016/05/07/44782-2)`).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Due to the pain involved, Duchenne did not get too far with this research, but
    his research into how emotions were displayed through facial expressions showed
    that the face is a roadmap to emotion. Around 1855, he developed a method to use
    electroshock stimulation to trigger muscular response, and he wrote about his
    findings in *Mécanisme de la physionomie humaine*. The result was what you see
    in [Figure 8-24](#c08-fig-0024).

    so we could go out and have our final team dinner at our favorite sushi place.

    to do the closing ceremonies, and then we could finally decompress. I was trying

    not just fatigue but utter exhaustion. Another person was expressing some serious
    distress.
