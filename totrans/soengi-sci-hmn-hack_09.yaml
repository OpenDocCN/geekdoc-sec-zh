    (Wiley, 2010), I was relatively new to the world of nonverbals. But I had started
    a relationship with Dr. Paul Ekman and learned from him as my mentor. Dr. Paul
    Ekman started his journey to understand nonverbals in the late 1950s, and for

- en: 'Understanding that nonverbals and emotions can affect the target profoundly
    should help you determine how to use these emotions during your social engineering
    gigs. To this effect, one of the most profound lessons I learned from Dr. Ekman
    is that not only does having an emotion trigger a nonverbal response, but if you
    were to force the nonverbal on yourself, you can trigger the emotion. This concept
    was backed up by numerous researchers, including in a study titled “Inhibiting
    and Facilitating Conditions of the Human Smile: A Nonobtrusive Test of the Facial
    Feedback Hypothesis” (`[www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3379579](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3379579)`).
    Researchers Strack, Martin, and Stepper tested Dr. Ekman''s hypothesis from the
    1970s and 1980s and were able to show that if you create the expression, you can
    trigger the emotion. They did this by asking subjects to put a pen in their mouth
    to trigger muscular usage that simulated a smile. They were able to prove the
    same thing that Dr. Ekman stated in his research: Creating the facial expression
    (even by force) creates the emotion associated with it.'

    electroshock stimulation to trigger muscular response, and he wrote about his

    facial expression known as smiling. But as a professional social engineer, you
    need to learn to recognize other body-language indicators of happiness.

- en: How is the emotion of happiness displayed by a person's body language? If happiness
    releases strong neuro chemicals and creates a confident environment, then we can
    expect to see certain body expressions, too. Look for body postures like those
    shown in [Figure 8-25](#c08-fig-0025), [Figure 8-26](#c08-fig-0026), and [Figure
    8-27](#c08-fig-0027).

    the mouth forming a closed- or open-mouthed smile (see [Figure 8-28](#c08-fig-0028)).
    Many times, people who feel happy also lean in toward the object of their happiness.

- en: Happiness is one of the emotions I look to use frequently as a professional
    social engineer. Appealing to a person's ego is a great way to create happiness
    that can lead to an emotional decision. For this to work, though, the ego appeal
    must be realistic, believable, and appropriate to the level of rapport you have
    built at that moment.

    a relatively short chapter. As I mentioned in the outset, my hope is that by going
    through a high-level overview of this information, you could walk away with a
    few different things in your arsenal. Understanding how emotion works will benefit
    you for many pretexts. The more you understand about what someone is saying without
    using words can help you to understand their communications much more clearly.
    Here are the main ideas that I hope you take away from this chapter:'

- en: I want to tell you one more story about social engineering that might help solidify
    the ideas of this chapter. During one DEF CON, I had an interaction with an employee
    that helped me see how important it is to be observant of nonverbals all the time.

- en: The conference is always a busy time for me and my team. I feel like I rarely
    get a break or even a few minutes to myself during those five days. I just flip
    the switch “on” and leave it there as I feed off the energy and positive vibes
    from the crowd.
  id: totrans-275

- en: This is powerful for me, but it can also make me unaware of others' feelings.
    I bounce around, barking out orders and making sure things are getting done. At
    this one conference, I had given a few orders to some of the employees to get
    things packed up. It was our last day, and we were rushing to get everything organized
    so we could go out and have our final team dinner at our favorite sushi place.

    to do the closing ceremonies, and then we could finally decompress. I was trying
    to be more aware of others' emotions, and I noticed one person's face registered
    not just fatigue but utter exhaustion. Another person was expressing some serious
    distress.
  id: totrans-277

    request to sit out of this part—you don't need to come to closing.”

    her out without creating problems in front of others. The emotion I was reading
    on her was a mix of sadness, anger, and fear.
  id: totrans-284
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I approached her privately, pulling her away from the group, and asked if she
    was okay. I won't describe the interaction in detail, but there were a lot of
    tears. She was feeling stress because she felt like things got dropped or ignored.
    And she was very stressed due to the lack of downtime.

    particularly observant and attentive to my team's emotions. However, I realized
    that I should have been using this skill throughout all five days of the conference
    to notice issues before we got to that level of stress.

    the engagement. Look for “flags,” but also be observant during all communications.
    Be observant for changes in the baseline and for emotional leakage that can help
    you see what a person might be feeling before, during, and even after your interaction.'
