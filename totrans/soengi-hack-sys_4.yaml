- en: Social engineering attacks are more effective when the bait or the ploy fits
    into a context that the recipient of a message relates to as routine or normal.
    That message could be about football or baseball, making it of interest to sports
    fans. Bait messages promising nude photos of celebrities have also worked well
    in the past. The vast amount of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) available
    on the Internet makes it easy for social engineering attackers to find subject
    matter that is relatable to individuals in their private lives and to corporate
    employees in the pursuit of their business activities. Thus, the information that
    is publicly available about individuals or organizations has become a security
    issue, because it can be used in socially engineered attacks on systems or in
    attempts to defraud or steal identities. This chapter reviews the security issues
    surrounding PII.

    that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual’s identity, either alone
    or when combined with other personal or identifying information that is linked
    or linkable to a specific individual. The definition of PII is not necessarily
    anchored to any single category of information or technology. Rather, it requires
    a case-by-case assessment of the specific risk that an individual can be identified
    from the information. In performing this assessment, it is important for an agency
    to recognize that non-PII can become PII whenever additional information is made
    publicly available in any medium and from any source that, when combined with
    other available information, could be used to identify an individual. [¹](#re_TNF-CH005_CIT00001)

- en: Another perspective on PII contends that it is any representation of information
    that permits the identity of an individual to whom the information applies to
    be reasonably inferred by either direct or indirect means. Further, PII is defined
    as information that directly identifies an individual (name, address, social security
    number (SSN) or other identifying number or code, telephone number, email address,
    etc.) or by which an agency intends to identify specific individuals in conjunction
    with other data elements, that is, indirect identification. (These data elements
    may include a combination of gender, race, birth date, geographic indicator, and
    other descriptors.) Additionally, information permitting the physical or online
    contacting of a specific individual is the same as personally identifiable information.
    This information can be maintained in either paper or electronic or other media.

    individual. For example, if two databases contain different PII elements, then
    someone with access to both databases may be able to link the information from
    the two databases and identify individuals, as well as access additional information
    about or relating to the individuals. If the secondary information source is present
    on the same system or a closely related system and does not have security controls
    that effectively segregate the information sources, then the data are considered
    linked. If the secondary information source is maintained more remotely, such

    protect personal information, such as the Privacy Act of 1974, OMB memoranda,
    and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). Additionally,
    some federal agencies, such as the Census Bureau and the Internal Revenue Service
    (IRS), are subject to additional specific legal obligations to protect certain
    types of PII. Some organizations are also subject to specific legal requirements
    based on their role. For example, organizations acting as financial institutions
    by engaging in financial activities are subject to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act
    (GLBA). Also, some agencies that collect PII for statistical purposes are subject
    to the strict confidentiality requirements of the Confidential Information Protection
    and Statistical Efficiency Act (CIPSEA). Violations of these laws can result in
    civil or criminal penalties. Organizations may also be obliged to protect PII

    youth can be bullied or can bully others. The two modes of bullying include direct
    (e.g., bullying that occurs in the presence of a targeted youth) and indirect
    (e.g., bullying not directly communicated to a targeted youth, such as spreading
    rumors). In addition to these two modes, the four types of bullying include broad
    categories of physical, verbal, relational (e.g., efforts to harm the reputation
    or relationships of the targeted youth), and damage to property.

    threatening or harassing electronic communications) and relational aggression

    the modification, dissemination, damage, or destruction of a youth’s privately
