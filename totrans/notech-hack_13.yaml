  zh: 你们的徽章在哪里？
- en: I like slipping into buildings as the phone guy. It’s my favorite getup, because
    I’ve got the gear, the lingo, and the outfit. But without the official-looking
    badge, I’m just some nimrod with a bag of gadgets and a dorky shirt. The badge
    makes the look, and the look makes me the phone guy. But isn’t a badge nothing
    more than a laminated bit of paper? No, it’s really so much more than that. In
    security lingo, it’s an *authentication token.* When I present it to someone,
    they look at it and draw a conclusion about who I am. Visual identification makes
    for weak authentication, but that’s how it works inside most of my target buildings,
    so I leverage that fatal security flaw. Knowing that a no-tech hacker can easily
    duplicate a badge after sneaking one quick look, I’m pretty surprised at the hundreds
    of badges I spot out in the open every single week.

  zh: 我喜欢扮成电话人进入建筑物。这是我最喜欢的装束，因为我有工具、术语和服装。但是没有正式的徽章，我就只是一个带着一袋小玩意和一个傻傻的衬衫的笨蛋。徽章让造型完美，而造型让我成为电话人。但是徽章难道不仅仅是一张覆膜的纸吗？不，它真的远不止这些。在安全术语中，它是一种*身份验证令牌*。当我把它递给别人时，他们会看着它并得出一个关于我的结论。视觉识别导致弱身份验证，但这就是大多数我攻击目标建筑物内部的工作方式，所以我利用了这个致命的安全漏洞。知道一个非技术的黑客可以在偷偷看了一眼后轻松复制一个徽章，我对我每周在公开场合发现的数百个徽章感到相当惊讶。
- en: Even though I catch these silly things out in the open so often, I still get
    giddy when I see a new one because I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that I could
    somehow use it to gain access to that company. Even if they employ some sort of
    electronic system to validate the card—we’ll talk more about those systems later
    in this chapter—I could probably use the badge to tailgate or social engineer
    my way inside. Getting giddy about site badges is weird, I know, but I’ve come
    to accept that I’m just not normal. So these days I go all the way. I carry a
    camera wherever I go to capture badges I spot in the wild, like the one in the
    next photo which I spotted flapping around in a local mall.

    it comes to enforcing this policy. I was not surprised to discover so few open-air
    badges around more secretive government buildings. The keyword here is *few.*
    While spending some time in the D.C. corridor, I came upon an outdoor barbeque

    for the various corporate tenants, some of which were government related. As I

    hire sometimes-careless human beings. The *policies* in place at the Pentagon
    ensure that careless behavior does not negatively impact the security posture
    of the facility, and corporate security officers should take this lesson to heart.
    Visual identification of an employee badge is not a secure authentication mechanism.
    Do not allow any avenue for social engineers. Establish a secure access mechanism
    and back it up with sound, enforceable policy that employees understand and are
    bound to. Employees should understand that security is not someone else’s problem.

    No-tech hackers realize this, and will prey on this security weakness in creative
    and often effective ways. All through this book you’ve seen examples where people
    noticed me not only spying on them, but recording them and their environments.
    Why didn’t they stop me or alert someone? Perhaps some of them didn’t care. But
    in most cases, people don’t react because they don’t know what to do. If you want
    the folks in your organization to challenge trespassers or report odd incidents,
    you need to do two things well:'

  zh: 门花了整整十五秒才关上，这是我亲眼目睹过的关上最慢的门之一。当然，这会给坏人提供充足的时间悄悄通过。尽管我以这个政府设施为例，但我见过数百个公司大楼的安全性甚至比这个还要差。这里的要点是，尽管先进安全系统的出现，大多数安全系统仍然依赖于*人类*，他们通常是懒惰的、无知的，或者两者都有。无技术黑客意识到了这一点，并将以创造性和常常有效的方式利用这种安全漏洞。在本书中，你看到了很多例子，人们不仅注意到我在监视他们，还录制了他们和他们的环境。为什么他们不阻止我或通知别人呢？也许其中一些人不在乎。但在大多数情况下，人们不作反应是因为他们不知道该怎么做。如果你想让你组织中的人挑战闯入者或者报告异常事件，你需要做好两件事：
- en: 1) Provide incentives for reporting suspicious activities. This doesn’t have
    to mean money. Recognition and praise at company gatherings sends the signal that
    “alert = good” and proactive people will be rewarded.2) Make your desired response
    both well known and easy to do.

  zh: 1）提供举报可疑活动的奖励。这不一定意味着金钱。在公司聚会上表彰和赞扬会传递出“警觉=好”的信号，积极主动的人会得到奖励。2）让你期望的响应既众所周知又容易实现。
- en: Honestly … if you saw me outside your office zooming in on your PC and snapping
    pictures, do you know who you should notify? Do your co-workers? It’s not enough
    to have an “Intrusion Response Policy” if no one knows what it is. Publicize it
    periodically and repeatedly, rehearse it, and who knows–maybe in the next few
    months, you’ll bag yourself a few no-tech hackers!

  zh: 诚实地说... 如果你看到我在你办公室外拍摄你的电脑并拍照，你知道你应该通知谁吗？你的同事们知道吗？如果没有人知道这是什么，只有一个“入侵响应政策”是不够的。定期和反复宣传它，并排练它，谁知道——也许在接下来的几个月里，你会抓到几个无技术黑客！
