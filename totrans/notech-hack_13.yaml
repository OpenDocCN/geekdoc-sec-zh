- en: I like slipping into buildings as the phone guy. It’s my favorite getup, because
    I’ve got the gear, the lingo, and the outfit. But without the official-looking
    badge, I’m just some nimrod with a bag of gadgets and a dorky shirt. The badge
    makes the look, and the look makes me the phone guy. But isn’t a badge nothing
    more than a laminated bit of paper? No, it’s really so much more than that. In
    security lingo, it’s an *authentication token.* When I present it to someone,
    they look at it and draw a conclusion about who I am. Visual identification makes
    for weak authentication, but that’s how it works inside most of my target buildings,
    so I leverage that fatal security flaw. Knowing that a no-tech hacker can easily
    duplicate a badge after sneaking one quick look, I’m pretty surprised at the hundreds
    of badges I spot out in the open every single week.

    giddy when I see a new one because I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that I could
    somehow use it to gain access to that company. Even if they employ some sort of
    electronic system to validate the card—we’ll talk more about those systems later
    in this chapter—I could probably use the badge to tailgate or social engineer
    my way inside. Getting giddy about site badges is weird, I know, but I’ve come
    to accept that I’m just not normal. So these days I go all the way. I carry a
    camera wherever I go to capture badges I spot in the wild, like the one in the
    next photo which I spotted flapping around in a local mall.

    of course) I was sucked into the drone of a corporate cheerleading slideshow spewing
    from the wall-mounted flat screen. Right before I lapsed into a fit of bored unconsciousness,
    I saw the screen shown in the next photo. I nearly fell over in my armchair trying
    to get my camera out in time.

    when leaving the workplace. The more secretive agencies are very proactive when
    it comes to enforcing this policy. I was not surprised to discover so few open-air
    badges around more secretive government buildings. The keyword here is *few.*
    While spending some time in the D.C. corridor, I came upon an outdoor barbeque
    catered by an office leasing company. The event was designed to show appreciation
    for the various corporate tenants, some of which were government related. As I
    wandered around the large catering tent, I was amazed at the number of badges
    I spotted. I was so busy snapping pictures of people that I nearly forgot to chow
    down on the free grub.

    away from airport property. At this point, I will refuse to mention the recent
    spate of news stories about the TSA misplacing several hundred uniforms. I can
    also neither confirm nor deny whether it is or is not possible to gain unauthorized
    access to any airport property when decked out in (or not decked out in) a TSA
    uniform.

    my eye (not in that way). The taller of the two was very important-looking. She
    was dressed in a smart black suit and was having an important-sounding conversation
    on her Blackberry. It wasn’t the geek-chic cell phone that caught my eye, but
    rather the plethora of badges and paraphernalia dangling from her lanyard. Traveling
    in tech circles, I’ve seen my share of lanyard clutter, but this lady took the
    prize for most neck-flair toted by a female.

    took a few photos—which neither of them seemed to notice—and after checking them
    out I realized I had a horrible angle on the more interesting badge. As she continued
    chatting into the phone, I swung around to the other side of her and stepped in
    as close as I could without triggering her (admittedly impaired) stalker detection
    system. Less than a foot away from her, I snapped the next photo.

    The Post-It note reminds her to “bring a copy of yesterday’s all hands to DSS
    H.Q.” Granted, security at the Pentagon is second to none. I know from personal
    experience that the guards stationed at the Pentagon mean business. They are not
    to be trifled with. I also know that visual identification of a badge at the Pentagon
    means absolutely nothing. All badges are electronically verified, and the security
    of that electronic process is world-class. I’m also pretty sure those wicked-looking
    automatic rifles the guards have are real.

    their employees were with their badges. I’m not pointing my finger at the Pentagon,
    but I think it’s important to mention that even the most die-hard government agencies
    hire sometimes-careless human beings. The *policies* in place at the Pentagon
    ensure that careless behavior does not negatively impact the security posture
    of the facility, and corporate security officers should take this lesson to heart.
    Visual identification of an employee badge is not a secure authentication mechanism.
    Do not allow any avenue for social engineers. Establish a secure access mechanism
    and back it up with sound, enforceable policy that employees understand and are
    bound to. Employees should understand that security is not someone else’s problem.

    an insecure security procedure. Electronic verification is a much more secure
    method of authentication, but these systems have security issues as well and the
    no-tech attacks against them are pretty interesting. It’s not uncommon to see
    proximity-type cards in plain view, as the next photo shows.

    *contactless* cards, but they can be attacked in similar ways. Both can be copied,
    but thanks to the device developed by Jonathan Westhues (detailed at http://cq.cx/prox.pl)
    contactless cards can be copied from a distance even when they are carried in
    a pocket or purse. To prevent this type of attack, consider combining access cards
    with PIN identification schemes, or deploy a system that relies on encryption,
    challenge-response systems, or reader access lists, like HiD’s *iClass* line.

    their access cards were still in plain view. Although the possibility existed
    for cloning the cards, in the spirit of no-tech hacking, an alternative attack
    is possible. An adversary can simply look at the card to learn a lot about it.
    Consider the typical *Datawatch* card shown in the next photo.

    adversary has to do is call the number speak to (or mildly social engineer) a

    and building number the card will work on, but in some cases the suite or room
    number as well.

    a “personal policy” and offering the technician an easy out, he made himself seem
    less threatening (CP is one of the good guys after all). By offering the guy a
    drink, he put the tech’s mind at ease, and it’s very likely that he never reported
    the incident. Had CP been one of the bad guys, there could easily be a no-tech
    telco “repairman” in your offices right now.

    attack. As I was driving around one day, I spotted a very distinct government
    blue-badger out for a lunchtime stroll. Since I was driving through a normal-looking
    office park, the appearance of a govie badge surprised me. By the time I turned
    my car around to get a photo, I lost track of the govie. I pulled into one of
    the many parking lots and drove around to try to figure out which building belonged
    to the government. All of the buildings looked the same, and many of them were
    unmarked, which made my job even more difficult. I thought of glancing inside
    some of the dumpsters, but since this wasn’t a pay gig, I thought better of it—gigs
    can go bad quickly without a *get out of jail free* card. Instead, I continued
    to cruise the parking lots in search of more badges. Then I spotted a familiar
    parking permit. I walked up to the vehicle and snapped the next photo.

    slow laps around the building, watching for employees. After a few laps, I saw
    the guy in the next picture come out of the building. Do you see what I saw?

    the photo looked right at me as I drove past filming him out the window, but he
    didn’t seem to notice. He was busy chatting on his cell phone. I decided to park
    my car and walk around the building on foot. I walked past several employees as
    I lapped the building, and found it difficult to discreetly capture badge photos
    while walking, so I gave up on discretion and just started filming like a normal
    person. With the camera up to eye level, I captured the next still as a video
    clip.

    acknowledge her either—I was busy with my camera. Next, I decided to camp outside
    one of the side entrances. I put my camera on a curb with the lens facing the
    door, and let it film. I stood next to the camera, and every now and then I would
    bend down and fiddle with the laces on my shoes (I hadn’t worn my special Velcro
    sneakers that day). This, of course made me seem less like a suspicious camper.
    I caught lots of great stills, like the one shown below.

    No-tech hackers realize this, and will prey on this security weakness in creative
