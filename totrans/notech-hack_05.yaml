    up, but it is a sport—a hacker sport. Forget what you think you know about hackers
    eyeballing your password as you poke it out on your keyboard. We’re talking about
    the X-Games version where hackers suck super-secret data of a laptop using only
    their minds. No psychic friends network here, just pure caffeinated hacker ingenuity.
    If you like having a screen on your laptop so you can see what you’re working
    on, don’t read this chapter. Because you might just want to rip your laptop’s
    screen clean off when you experience shoulder surfing through the eyes of a no-tech
    hacker.

- en: '*Shoulder surfing* is a classic no-tech attack that’s been around about as
    long as shoulders themselves. It’s a simple attack. All a bad guy does is peer
    over a victim’s shoulder to see what he or she is up to. Back in the old days
    (before 1990 or so) this technique was used to snag calling card digits as a victim
    entered them into a public pay phone. A thief could reuse those digits to make
    free long distance calls, or sell them to others for less than market value. Although
    there are much easier ways to capture calling card digits these days, the skill
    of keypad monitoring still has many very practical uses. For example, consider
    the security screen below, presented at the cash register of an office supply
    store.'

    accessible terminals), this one prompts for an employee number and password. The
    kiosk allows access privileges based on the credentials entered. A manager will
    obviously have a higher level of access than an employee or a customer (who typically
    has no credentials). For certain transactions, such as the return of a high-value
    item, a manager login is required. As the next photo shows, a skilled keypad watcher
    (or cell phone video cam user) can capture the keystrokes as they are entered.

    digital, shoulder surfers turned their glances from keypads to keyboards, hunting
    not for calling card numbers, but for passwords. This is no easy trick. Every
    time I try to pull it off, I’m reminded of the classic move *Sneakers.* The entire
    hacker “dream team” was baffled by video footage of a mathematician entering his
    password. Rewinding the footage, they eventually realized the password was indiscernible—the
    victim was just in the way. Fortunately, this chapter isn’t about catching those
    fleeting passwords. It’s about being observant and realizing that shoulder surfers
    have evolved beyond keyboard-watching.

    A hacker might swing around behind the machine to get a glimpse of the screen
    in an attempt to learn more about this target. But a decent no-tech hacker (or
    an astute observer) would instead check out the business card taped to the laptop
    lid which reveals the target’s name, company, job title, address, office phone
    and cell phone number. The tape-on business card phenomenon is becoming quite

    in English and what I guess is Chinese. Even an illiterate laptop thief might
    get the clue that this laptop is one worth stealing. This brings up an important
    point. While laptop stickers can be used to profile a victim, they can also serve
    to mark a laptop as valuable, making the owner a target for theft or physical
    violence. I’m reminded of the U.S. Government “Classified,” “Secret,” and “Top
    Secret” stickers which I’ve seen in the field. While I understand the practical
    value of these stickers in a mixed-classification government environment, I’ve
    seen way too many of them out in the wild. Even the benign “Unclassified” sticker
    is an indication that the device is used in or around government spaces, making
    the device a target for thieves, spies and UFO conspiracy theorists.

    Check-in kiosks clearly display information such as the traveler’s name, destination,

    you are presenting, and tone it down if necessary. If you’ve got to work on private
    stuff in public, consider a laptop privacy filter (try a Google search for “laptop
    privacy filter”). Of course bear in mind that an experienced shoulder surfer will
    see a privacy filter and rightly assume you’re working on something sensitive.
    Because of this, the mere existence of a filter can make you or your machine a
    target. Did I mention leaving the private stuff out of public spaces? That’s your

    white headphones are an iPod signature item. The off-screen Mac Addict magazine
    seals the deal—he’s a bona fide Apple fan-boy. Closer examination reveals that
    he’s also a gamer. The icons in his dock (shown below) mean that he’s installed
    World of Warcraft (WoW) and Ventrillo voice communication software.

    console of a BEA WebLogic server. Given that Weblogic is heavyweight industrial-grade
    software, it’s safe to assume that he’s busy with work—perhaps even official U.S.
    Government business. As he typed his credentials, I made a quick adjustment to
    my camera and took another photo. The flash fired, and the target turned around
    sharply, finally noticing me. I looked down at the camera and rubbed my eyes,
    pretending to be blinded by my own flash. He shrugged and returned to his work,
    convinced, I assume, that I was some kind of digital camera newbie just figuring
    out the ropes. This road warrior did not *want* to assume I was taking a picture
    of him. That, of course could create all sorts of unpleasantness for him. So he
    did what most portable computer users do–he assumed the best, and went back to
    his work. This makes the job of a no-tech hacker even easier.

    you. What I would suggest is that you close your machine if you think you’re a
    target and become interested in something else, like sipping your coffee. Most
    no-tech hackers will know they’ve been busted and move along. If they do, keep
    a casual eye on them as they leave and try to get a good look at them and their
    car/bike/skateboard/Segway before they bail. When they’ve cleared out take a look
    at what you were working on, consider all of it compromised, and act accordingly.
    If your surfer doesn’t bail after you close your lid, keep an eye on him or her
    anyhow. If he or she continues acting suspiciously, do something about it. Inform
    a manager, security guard or hall monitor. Do *something.* If that something involves
    physical violence, just don’t tell the judge it was my idea.

    Airplanes are tough places to shoulder surf because a surfer is generally limited

    window seat, and the aisle seat next to me was occupied by an awake and over-caffeinated
    stranger. Still, when my neighbor stood up to go to the bathroom, I couldn’t resist
    the wide-open photo opportunity. I turned off my flash, and took the next photo.

    realized that his entire demeanor screamed *government.* His wing tips were nice,
    but not too nice. His binder was decidedly Government Issue, and the glance I
    stole of his laptop bag revealed what looked like a government insignia of some
    sort. I watched disinterested for a few more moments until my shot-blocking neighbor
    returned. As he settled into his seat, he grabbed the in-flight magazine and started
    flipping through it. Figuring my game of surf-the-fed was at an end; I closed
    my camera and tried to find something better to do. I remember feeling relieved.
    Despite how good the session might be, surfing is still hard work. But as fate
    would have it, the game wasn’t quite over—it was just beginning. The fed pulled
    out a notebook stuffed with interesting-looking paperwork. Getting a shot of that
    paperwork from the other side of the plane seemed tricky, but I held up my jacket
    to form an impromptu curtain, flicked the zoom and took a quick shot. No one seemed
    to notice.

    as I realized I was at 30,000 feet surfing the government’s 2006 strategic plan
    for their electronic warfare signals intelligence something-or-other. I immediately
    stopped taking photos of my careless Fed friend and have been stalked by black
    helicopters ever since. I’m not too freaked out by that though, because now I
    know how to disable their electronic systems with a cheap digital watch and a
    patch of duct tape. Although sometimes at night my wife complains about the noise.

    a photo of his screen. I reviewed the image and realized that the camera had focused
    on his blinds, making the on-screen text completely unreadable. The manager continued
    working at his desk, so I adjusted my focal length (which took me a while because
    it’s something I rarely have to do) and snapped a few more photos. Eventually,
    I got a few like the one below, which captured the screen text in perfect clarity.

    I had a realization–stealing money from a bank is *so lame.* The information housed
    by a bank is worth so much more than the actual liquid assets they have in the
    vault. Professional criminals and amateur identity thieves alike could easily
    liquidate a bank’s information stores to reap millions of dollars in cold, hard
    (unmarked) cash, with far less risk than storming a lobby and taking hostages.
    I wondered how much one screen of personal information would fetch. As I pondered
    how rich I would be if I was one of the bad guys, the banker stood up from his
    desk and left his office unattended. I fiddled with the zoom again and snapped
    a few photos of the contents of his desk. Eventually the zoom settings cooperated
    and I captured a clear image of his paperwork.

    to sell on the black market to pay my bail money. It hadn’t dawned on me that
    he might actually have gone to alert security about his new voyeuristic hacker
    friend. He shuffled around the desk, adjusted his belt and his pants and plopped
    down into his overstuffed chair without casting me a single glance.

    bumping into an office employee out on a smoke break. The employee never noticed
    me—he was busy chatting on his cell phone, right outside the banker’s office.
    I suddenly realized that the banker “tuned out” everyone lingering outside his
    office. He had gotten so used to passers by that now everyone outside his window
    (including no-tech hacker types with cameras) was a harmless irrelevance. Security
    guards often suffer from the same problem after watching a video monitor for hours
    on end. They get so used to nothing happening that when something finally does,
    they miss it.
