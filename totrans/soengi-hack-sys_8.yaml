    The global environment is polluted in every way possible (e.g., people over-produce
    and dump waste into the water, burn coal and release toxins in the air, use open-air
    trash dumps). Many nations are dominated by dictators and military regimes and
    free press is being restricted around the world so that greedy and masochistic
    monsters can control wealth, people, and even thought. Racism, sexism, xenophobia,
    Islamophobia, homophobia, religious oppression, sexual exploitation, violence,
    animal cruelty, and bad manners are rampant around the globe and are even supported
    by many world leaders. So the habits then moved into cyberspace. Those people
    who have done bad deeds and evil acts in the physical world have unfortunately
    brought their inhumanity to cyberspace and found a place where they can thrive,
    virtually unhindered. Without drastic, well-directed action things in cyberspace
    will continue to deteriorate.

- en: He also commented on the evolution of cyber threats and discussed the many forms
    that cyber vulnerability can take. It was not that long ago, he contended, that
    cybersecurity simply meant deleting emails from a Nigerian prince who needed your
    help in making a bank deposit. Beyond basic email hygiene, there are threats to
    entire networks. True, the network owner can take extra precautions to secure
    the network, but that security can be undermined by one user who connects to it
    with an infected device or downloads a spear phishing email is worrisome. Network
    threats by definition can be as serious as the criticality of the infrastructure
    or equipment controlled by the network or the sensitivity of the information conveyed
    by the network.

- en: Admiral Rogers pointed out that a great deal of time and attention had already
    been spent assessing today’s cyber threat. Study after study has echoed the gravity
    of cybersecurity vulnerability. Experts agree that the threat is so grave because
    barriers to entry and the risk of getting caught for mischief are extremely low
    while potential rewards are great. Malicious cyber tools are cheap and widely
    available on the Internet. One lone actor with few resources now has the power
    to wreak havoc on a network anonymously. Cybercrimes are notoriously hard to track
    and attribution can be challenging at best. These same studies typically put malicious
    cyber activity into one of three categories. First, there is cybercrime, in which
    criminals are seeking money outright or something else of value to resell, such
    as credit card numbers, tax IDs, and social security numbers, or in which they
    hold corporate data for ransom. The second category is cyber espionage, which
    typically involves nation-states and includes both political espionage and espionage
    for commercial gain, such as the theft of trade secrets for economic advantage.
    And third, there is general cyber mischief, which includes hacktivists who use
    cyber vulnerabilities to spread propaganda, like ISIS, and those who seek to disrupt
    services or sites. [¹](#re_TNF-CH009_CIT00001)

  zh: 罗杰斯上将指出，大量时间和精力已经花在评估当今的网络威胁上。一次又一次的研究都强调了网络安全漏洞的严重性。专家们一致认为，威胁之所以如此严重，是因为进入门槛低，恶作剧被抓到的风险极低，而潜在回报却很大。恶意网络工具在互联网上廉价且广泛可得。一个资源匮乏的独立行动者现在有能力匿名对网络造成严重破坏。网络犯罪极难追踪，而归因最多时也是具有挑战性的。这些研究通常将恶意网络活动归为三类。首先是网络犯罪，其中犯罪分子直接谋求金钱或其他有价值的东西，如信用卡号码、纳税人识别号和社会保障号码，或者他们为了索要赎金而持有公司数据。第二类是网络间谍活动，通常涉及国家机构，包括政治间谍活动和为了商业利益而进行的间谍活动，比如为了经济利益而窃取商业机密。第三类是一般的网络恶作剧，包括利用网络漏洞传播宣传的黑客活动，比如ISIS，以及那些试图破坏服务或网站的人。[¹](#re_TNF-CH009_CIT00001)
- en: In April 2018, NSA General Counsel Glenn Gerstell presented remarks on How We
    Need to Prepare for a Global Cyber Pandemic at The Cipher Brief Threat Conference,
    at Sea Island, Georgia. He told a story that, in the early 1990s, an enterprising
    hot dog vendor in Russia seized upon the entrepreneurial opportunities created
    by the collapse of the Soviet Union to start his own catering company. He eventually
    grew his business and his restaurants and threw opulent banquets for Kremlin officials,
    earning him the nickname Putin’s Cook. Yevgeny Prigozhin’s company even won a
    contract in 2011 to deliver school lunches across Moscow, but children would not
    eat the food, complaining that it smelled rotten. Bad publicity ensued. Prigozhin’s
    company responded, not by upgrading the food, but by hiring people to flood the
    Internet with postings praising the food and rejecting complaints. Presumably,
    they found it cheaper to use the Internet to write fake reviews than to fund good
    quality hot dogs for schoolchildren.

  zh: 2018年4月，NSA总顾问格伦·格斯特尔在乔治亚州西海岛的The Cipher Brief威胁会议上发表了关于我们如何应对全球网络大流行的讲话。他讲述了一个故事，说在上世纪90年代初，一位俄罗斯的热狗摊主抓住了苏联解体所创造的创业机会，开始经营自己的餐饮公司。他最终发展了自己的业务和餐厅，并为克里姆林宫官员举办奢华的宴会，因此被称为普京的厨师。叶甫根尼·普里戈津的公司甚至在2011年赢得了在莫斯科全市提供学校午餐的合同，但孩子们不吃这些食物，抱怨说闻起来臭。随之而来的是负面宣传。普里戈津的公司的反应不是升级食物质量，而是雇佣人员在互联网上发布赞扬食物并拒绝投诉的帖子。显然，他们发现使用互联网撰写虚假评论比为学生提供优质热狗更便宜。
- en: Then, not many years later, and perhaps building upon this experience, Prigozhin
    and his companies funded and largely controlled an organization, which began in
    2013 or 2014, called the Internet Research Agency (IRA). In the IRA’s office building
    in St. Petersburg, hundreds of individuals worked around the clock as Internet
    content producers. Although the IRA’s original agenda was the online spread of
    pro-Russia and pro-Putin propaganda, that agenda quickly expanded westward.

  zh: 然后，不久之后，也许是基于这种经验，普里戈津及其公司资助并在很大程度上控制了一个组织，该组织始于2013年或2014年，名为互联网研究机构（IRA）。在位于圣彼得堡的IRA办公楼里，数百名个体全天候作为互联网内容制作者工作。尽管IRA最初的议程是在线传播亲俄罗斯和亲普京的宣传，但这一议程很快向西方扩展。
- en: With an annual budget of hundreds of millions of dollars, the IRA began to engage
    in a widespread and concerted campaign aimed at the United States. They socially
    engineered and created fictitious US personas on social media platforms that were
    designed to attract US audiences and sow discord regarding divisive US political
    and social issues. They used stolen social security numbers, home addresses, and
    birth dates of real US persons to open banking accounts to pay for expenses and
    to collect money from US citizens, and they produced and paid for political advertisements
    on US social media, concealing their true identity.

  zh: IRA 拥有数亿美元的年度预算，开始开展广泛而有计划的活动，旨在影响美国。他们在社交媒体平台上进行社会工程，并创造了虚假的美国人身份，旨在吸引美国受众，并在有关美国政治和社会问题的分裂性话题上播下分歧。他们使用真实美国人的被盗社保号码、家庭地址和出生日期来开设银行账户以支付开支，并从美国公民那里收集资金，并在美国社交媒体上制作并支付政治广告，隐藏其真实身份。
- en: Mr. Gerstell further commented that the details of the story he shared were
    from allegations made in newspaper articles and publicly available criminal charging
    documents filed against some of the main players in the IRA’s scheme. Prigozhin,
    the IRA, and several other Russian individuals and companies associated with the
    organization were indicted by Special Counsel Robert Mueller. The ultimate aim
    of this Russian Internet troll factory, according to that indictment, was to impair,
    obstruct, and defeat the lawful functions of the US government through fraud and
    deceit for the purpose of interfering with the US political and electoral processes,
    including the presidential election of 2016\. The defendants were charged with
    conspiracy to defraud the US; conspiracy to commit wire and bank fraud; and aggravated
    identity theft. The indictment highlights the lengths to which sophisticated nation-states
    will rely upon cyberspace to carry out their objectives. These allegations reflect
    a threat beyond just routine cybercrime and mischief; indeed, if true, they represent
    an attempt to strategically undermine institutions critical to the functioning
    of a democracy, and, at their core, they underscore the vulnerabilities created
    by our digital lives.

  zh: Gerstell 先生进一步评论说，他分享的故事的细节来自报纸文章中提出的指控，以及针对 IRA 计划的主要参与者之一提起的公开可获得的刑事诉讼文件。普里戈津、IRA
    和与该组织有关的几个其他俄罗斯个人和公司被特别检察官罗伯特·穆勒起诉。根据该起诉书，这个俄罗斯互联网巨魔工厂的最终目标是通过欺诈和欺骗来损害、阻碍和打败美国政府的合法职能，以干扰美国政治和选举过程，包括
    2016 年的总统选举。被告被控串谋欺诈美国；串谋实施电线和银行欺诈行为；以及严重身份盗窃。这起起诉书突显了先进国家将依赖网络空间来实现其目标的程度。这些指控反映了一种超出常规网络犯罪和恶作剧的威胁；事实上，如果属实，它们代表了一种试图战略性地破坏对民主运作至关重要的机构，并且在核心上，它们突显了我们数字生活所带来的漏洞。
- en: Mr. Gerstell then contended that 2018 represented another year in which the
    intelligence community (IC) had highlighted the gravity of the cyber threat in
    its annual worldwide threat assessment. That assessment reported that over 30
    countries were then believed to possess cyber attack capabilities. This number,
    which had increased almost every year since 2007, reflected the ease with which
    malicious cyber actors could obtain and deploy cyber weapons. Cyberspace has proven
    to be a relatively accessible vector in which to carry out malicious activities,
    and so less sophisticated nation-states and criminal actors were becoming better
    equipped in the use of cyber tool kits. China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia were
    seen as the nation-states posing the greatest cyber threat to the United States.
    The IC predicted that Russia, which has previously acted with impunity in this
    sphere, would conduct bolder and more disruptive cyber operations in the future.

  zh: Gerstell 先生接着指出，2018 年又是情报界（IC）在其年度全球威胁评估中突出了网络威胁严重性的一年。该评估报告称，当时有超过 30 个国家被认为拥有网络攻击能力。自
    2007 年以来，这个数字几乎每年都在增加，反映了恶意网络行为者可以轻松获取和部署网络武器的便利性。网络空间已被证明是进行恶意活动的相对容易的载体，因此，技术不那么先进的国家和犯罪行为者正在日益熟练地使用网络工具包。中国、伊朗、朝鲜和俄罗斯被视为对美国构成最大网络威胁的国家。情报界预测，俄罗斯在此领域曾经以无法无天的方式行事，未来将进行更大胆、更具破坏性的网络行动。
- en: Mr. Gerstell warned that the threats posed by malicious cyber activity had now
    combined with even greater toxicity to present unprecedented challenges across
    personal, professional, and political lives in the United States in a way that
    was hard to overstate. History and people’s own experiences have taught that the
    gravity, and perhaps the probability, of risks can collectively be underestimated,
    and that, as a society, people react only after a crisis or calamity. Several
    governments worried about secret surveillance by perceived adversary countries
    have begun banning electronic products from those countries, resulting in a global
    technology trade war.

  zh: 葛斯特尔先生警告称，恶意网络活动带来的威胁现在已经与更大的毒性结合在一起，以一种难以言喻的方式在美国的个人、职业和政治生活中呈现出前所未有的挑战。历史和人们自己的经验已经教导我们，风险的重要性，也许还有概率，可能被集体低估，并且作为一个社会，人们只会在危机或灾难之后才会做出反应。一些担心被认为是对手的国家的秘密监视的政府已经开始禁止来自这些国家的电子产品，导致全球技术贸易战。
- en: One conclusion Mr. Gerstell made was that a national cyber strategy would not
    be successful unless it facilitated engagement among the public sector, private
    companies, and other governments on cybersecurity. Importantly, educational efforts
    should be aimed at various types of audiences. For example, individual users might
    be most in need of tips and best practices for securing home networks and personal
    devices, while corporate network owners could benefit more from technical information
    tailored to their specific industry. The United Kingdom had started to make great
    strides in this area. Recognizing the need to speak directly to different types
    of audiences, the UK’s National Cybersecurity Centre had been issuing guidance
    tailored for readers of differing levels of sophistication. For example, the US’s
    National Counterintelligence and Security Center (NCSC) had posted commonsense
    guidance for everyday Internet users about how to implement meaningful password
    protection while avoiding cybersecurity fatigue, the recently documented phenomenon
    in which individuals are feeling overwhelmed by the scope of the cyber threat
    and frustrated with complex cybersecurity guidance. On another end of the spectrum,
    they also recently posted information for local authorities about securing systems
    supporting local elections.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 葛斯特尔先生得出的一个结论是，除非国家网络战略促进了公共部门、私营公司和其他政府在网络安全方面的参与，否则不会取得成功。重要的是，教育工作应该针对不同类型的受众。例如，个人用户可能最需要的是保护家庭网络和个人设备的技巧和最佳实践，而企业网络所有者可能更需要针对其特定行业量身定制的技术信息。英国在这方面已经开始取得巨大进展。英国国家网络安全中心认识到需要直接面向不同类型的受众，已经开始发布针对不同复杂程度读者的指南。例如，美国的国家反情报和安全中心（NCSC）已经发布了面向日常互联网用户的常识性指南，介绍了如何实施有意义的密码保护，同时避免网络安全指导所带来的疲劳感，这是最近被记录下来的一种现象，即个人感到对网络威胁的范围感到不知所措，并对复杂的网络安全指导感到沮丧。另一方面，他们最近也为地方政府发布了有关保护支持地方选举的系统的信息。
- en: Mr. Gerstell’s third and final point was that the federal government was a necessary,
    but not sufficient, participant in a unified cyber strategy. Indeed, when discussing
    how best to address the cyber threat, much importance had been given to the need
    for a whole-of-government approach. Yet, even at its most effective, the US government
    could not stand alone in securing the most critical systems while cyber vulnerabilities
    abound in other networks and systems not under government control. What was truly
    needed, he explained, could be more aptly described as a whole-of-users approach.
    Those users include, on one level or another, other nations, private-sector network
    owners, and even everyday citizen users of cyber technologies.

  zh: 葛斯特尔先生的第三个也是最后一个观点是，联邦政府是统一网络战略中必不可少但不够充分的参与者。实际上，当讨论如何最好地应对网络威胁时，对于需要全政府参与的重要性已经得到了很多关注。然而，即使在其最有效的时候，美国政府也无法独自保护最关键的系统，而网络和系统中的网络漏洞却在政府控制之外的其他网络和系统中泛滥。他解释说，真正需要的可以更恰当地描述为全用户参与的方法。这些用户包括其他国家、私营部门的网络所有者，甚至是日常使用网络技术的普通公民。
- en: To date, the US government has played a leading role in defending against and
    responding to malicious international cyber activity, whether acting alone or
    in concert with close allies like the United Kingdom. The United States also employs
    non-cyber tools, such as sanctions, public attribution, criminal charges, and
    extradition, in its responses to such activity. It would be helpful if other nations
    recognized the global nature of the problem and took a multilateral approach to
    cyber threat response.

  zh: 到目前为止，美国政府在防御和应对恶意的国际网络活动方面发挥了主导作用，无论是独自行动还是与像英国这样的亲密盟友合作。美国还采用非网络工具，如制裁、公开归因、刑事起诉和引渡，来应对此类活动。如果其他国家认识到问题的全球性质，并采取多边方式应对网络威胁，那将是有益的。
- en: In general, the private sector is well aware of the seriousness of the cyber
    threat, and some industries, such as the financial and electronic sector, have
    invested significant time and resources into shoring up their critical components
    and networks. There are many individuals and small businesses, however, who might
    not have the resources to invest in upgrading and maintaining expensive equipment,
    or access to trained personnel who could provide cybersecurity services, or who
    might be confused by complicated cybersecurity guidance, or simply think that
    they are too small to be a target. However, some private network owners, including
    those who control critical infrastructure are too often willing to accept some
    security risks in their networks that would be unacceptable to the government.

  zh: 总的来说，私营部门充分意识到网络威胁的严重性，一些行业，如金融和电子行业，已经投入了大量时间和资源来加固其关键组件和网络。然而，许多个人和小型企业可能没有资源投资于升级和维护昂贵的设备，或者没有接触过能够提供网络安全服务的受过训练的人员，或者对复杂的网络安全指导感到困惑，或者仅仅认为自己太小而不会成为目标。然而，一些私营网络所有者，包括那些控制关键基础设施的人，往往愿意接受在其网络中存在一些对政府来说是不可接受的安全风险。
- en: In closing, Mr. Gerstell prophesized that the enormity of these challenges could
    not be overstated. Malefactors of cybercrime would, in all probability, be ever
    more successful before society would be able to blunt or negate this threat. But
    this very probability, the sheer foreseeability of possible and grave harm, underscores
    the need for society to do more to counter this almost existential threat. The
    chosen alternative has been to wait until one cyber incident after another forces
    the adoption of piecemeal solutions to what was actually an overarching issue
    that should be addressed through a comprehensive approach. He contended that the
    United States needed to own this problem that the people have created, and take
    aggressive steps to manage it before a calamity occurred. After all, with a tool
    as accessible, cost-effective, and easy to use as cyberspace, the United States
    just could not predict from which hot dog cart the next big attack would emerge.

    another story was posted on the FBI website about a man who helped bust elder
    fraud conspiracies. It is a great story. The heavily accented caller who promised
    William Webster a grand sweepstakes prize of $72 million and a new Mercedes Benz
    had done most of his homework on his potential fraud target. What the caller,
    Keniel Thomas, 29, of Jamaica, missed was possibly the most salient detail about
    his intended victim, who was 90 years old at the time: William Webster had served
    as director of both the FBI and the CIA, and so had a pretty good radar for pernicious
    criminal schemes; in this case, a Jamaican lottery scam.'

    the familiar arc of scams that target the elderly: The caller promises riches
    but requires some form of payment to move the process forward. The caller demands
    more and more and then resorts to intimidation when the cooperation tapers off.
    In the Websters’ case, the former judge was told he had to pay $50,000 to get
    his prize. When the money was not forthcoming, the frequent calls escalated to
    scary threats, which led the couple to contact the FBI.'

    FBI for a decade beginning in 1978\. “But it did. And at that point, he shifted
    gears. Instead of sweet talk, he began to threaten Mrs. Webster.” In one expletive-filled
    recorded message left on the Websters’ phone, Thomas threatened to kill them and
    burn down their house if he didn’t get what he wanted. “You live at a very lonely
    place,” he said. “And the moment you arrive, I’m gonna put a shot in your head.”

    help in nabbing the caller by recording their phone conversations to build a case
    and develop a clear picture of the scheme. The legwork ultimately led to Thomas’
    arrest in 2017\. He was sentenced in 2019 by the Federal Court in Washington,
    DC, to nearly six years in prison. It also revealed that Thomas and his relatives

    these types of crimes since 2011, said the perpetrators frequently prey on older
    people because they tend to be more trusting, financially secure, and lonely.
    The fraudsters buy and trade lead lists on the Internet with senior citizens’
    names, phone numbers, and other personal information. Then they start calling,
