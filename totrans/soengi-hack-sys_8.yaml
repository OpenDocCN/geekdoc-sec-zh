    The global environment is polluted in every way possible (e.g., people over-produce
    and dump waste into the water, burn coal and release toxins in the air, use open-air
    trash dumps). Many nations are dominated by dictators and military regimes and
    free press is being restricted around the world so that greedy and masochistic
    monsters can control wealth, people, and even thought. Racism, sexism, xenophobia,
    Islamophobia, homophobia, religious oppression, sexual exploitation, violence,
    animal cruelty, and bad manners are rampant around the globe and are even supported
    by many world leaders. So the habits then moved into cyberspace. Those people
    who have done bad deeds and evil acts in the physical world have unfortunately
    brought their inhumanity to cyberspace and found a place where they can thrive,
    virtually unhindered. Without drastic, well-directed action things in cyberspace
    will continue to deteriorate.

    that cyber vulnerability can take. It was not that long ago, he contended, that
    cybersecurity simply meant deleting emails from a Nigerian prince who needed your
    help in making a bank deposit. Beyond basic email hygiene, there are threats to
    entire networks. True, the network owner can take extra precautions to secure
    the network, but that security can be undermined by one user who connects to it
    with an infected device or downloads a spear phishing email is worrisome. Network
    threats by definition can be as serious as the criticality of the infrastructure
    or equipment controlled by the network or the sensitivity of the information conveyed
    by the network.

- en: Admiral Rogers pointed out that a great deal of time and attention had already
    been spent assessing today’s cyber threat. Study after study has echoed the gravity
    of cybersecurity vulnerability. Experts agree that the threat is so grave because
    barriers to entry and the risk of getting caught for mischief are extremely low
    while potential rewards are great. Malicious cyber tools are cheap and widely
    available on the Internet. One lone actor with few resources now has the power
    to wreak havoc on a network anonymously. Cybercrimes are notoriously hard to track
    and attribution can be challenging at best. These same studies typically put malicious
    cyber activity into one of three categories. First, there is cybercrime, in which
    criminals are seeking money outright or something else of value to resell, such
    as credit card numbers, tax IDs, and social security numbers, or in which they
    hold corporate data for ransom. The second category is cyber espionage, which
    typically involves nation-states and includes both political espionage and espionage
    for commercial gain, such as the theft of trade secrets for economic advantage.
    And third, there is general cyber mischief, which includes hacktivists who use
    cyber vulnerabilities to spread propaganda, like ISIS, and those who seek to disrupt
    services or sites. [¹](#re_TNF-CH009_CIT00001)

- en: In April 2018, NSA General Counsel Glenn Gerstell presented remarks on How We
    Need to Prepare for a Global Cyber Pandemic at The Cipher Brief Threat Conference,
    at Sea Island, Georgia. He told a story that, in the early 1990s, an enterprising
    hot dog vendor in Russia seized upon the entrepreneurial opportunities created
    by the collapse of the Soviet Union to start his own catering company. He eventually
    grew his business and his restaurants and threw opulent banquets for Kremlin officials,
    earning him the nickname Putin’s Cook. Yevgeny Prigozhin’s company even won a
    contract in 2011 to deliver school lunches across Moscow, but children would not
    eat the food, complaining that it smelled rotten. Bad publicity ensued. Prigozhin’s
    company responded, not by upgrading the food, but by hiring people to flood the
    Internet with postings praising the food and rejecting complaints. Presumably,
    they found it cheaper to use the Internet to write fake reviews than to fund good
    quality hot dogs for schoolchildren.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Then, not many years later, and perhaps building upon this experience, Prigozhin
    and his companies funded and largely controlled an organization, which began in
    2013 or 2014, called the Internet Research Agency (IRA). In the IRA’s office building
    in St. Petersburg, hundreds of individuals worked around the clock as Internet
    content producers. Although the IRA’s original agenda was the online spread of
    pro-Russia and pro-Putin propaganda, that agenda quickly expanded westward.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With an annual budget of hundreds of millions of dollars, the IRA began to engage
    in a widespread and concerted campaign aimed at the United States. They socially
    engineered and created fictitious US personas on social media platforms that were
    designed to attract US audiences and sow discord regarding divisive US political
    and social issues. They used stolen social security numbers, home addresses, and
    birth dates of real US persons to open banking accounts to pay for expenses and
    to collect money from US citizens, and they produced and paid for political advertisements
    on US social media, concealing their true identity.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Mr. Gerstell further commented that the details of the story he shared were
    from allegations made in newspaper articles and publicly available criminal charging
    documents filed against some of the main players in the IRA’s scheme. Prigozhin,
    the IRA, and several other Russian individuals and companies associated with the
    organization were indicted by Special Counsel Robert Mueller. The ultimate aim
    of this Russian Internet troll factory, according to that indictment, was to impair,
    obstruct, and defeat the lawful functions of the US government through fraud and
    deceit for the purpose of interfering with the US political and electoral processes,
    including the presidential election of 2016\. The defendants were charged with
    conspiracy to defraud the US; conspiracy to commit wire and bank fraud; and aggravated
    identity theft. The indictment highlights the lengths to which sophisticated nation-states
    will rely upon cyberspace to carry out their objectives. These allegations reflect
    a threat beyond just routine cybercrime and mischief; indeed, if true, they represent
    an attempt to strategically undermine institutions critical to the functioning
    of a democracy, and, at their core, they underscore the vulnerabilities created
    by our digital lives.

- en: Mr. Gerstell then contended that 2018 represented another year in which the
    intelligence community (IC) had highlighted the gravity of the cyber threat in
    its annual worldwide threat assessment. That assessment reported that over 30
    countries were then believed to possess cyber attack capabilities. This number,
    which had increased almost every year since 2007, reflected the ease with which
    malicious cyber actors could obtain and deploy cyber weapons. Cyberspace has proven
    to be a relatively accessible vector in which to carry out malicious activities,
    and so less sophisticated nation-states and criminal actors were becoming better
    equipped in the use of cyber tool kits. China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia were
    seen as the nation-states posing the greatest cyber threat to the United States.
    The IC predicted that Russia, which has previously acted with impunity in this
    sphere, would conduct bolder and more disruptive cyber operations in the future.

- en: Mr. Gerstell warned that the threats posed by malicious cyber activity had now
    combined with even greater toxicity to present unprecedented challenges across
    personal, professional, and political lives in the United States in a way that
    was hard to overstate. History and people’s own experiences have taught that the
    gravity, and perhaps the probability, of risks can collectively be underestimated,
    and that, as a society, people react only after a crisis or calamity. Several
    governments worried about secret surveillance by perceived adversary countries
    have begun banning electronic products from those countries, resulting in a global
    technology trade war.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One conclusion Mr. Gerstell made was that a national cyber strategy would not
    be successful unless it facilitated engagement among the public sector, private
    companies, and other governments on cybersecurity. Importantly, educational efforts
    should be aimed at various types of audiences. For example, individual users might
    be most in need of tips and best practices for securing home networks and personal
    devices, while corporate network owners could benefit more from technical information
    tailored to their specific industry. The United Kingdom had started to make great
    strides in this area. Recognizing the need to speak directly to different types
    of audiences, the UK’s National Cybersecurity Centre had been issuing guidance
    tailored for readers of differing levels of sophistication. For example, the US’s
    National Counterintelligence and Security Center (NCSC) had posted commonsense
    guidance for everyday Internet users about how to implement meaningful password
    protection while avoiding cybersecurity fatigue, the recently documented phenomenon
    in which individuals are feeling overwhelmed by the scope of the cyber threat
    and frustrated with complex cybersecurity guidance. On another end of the spectrum,
    they also recently posted information for local authorities about securing systems
    supporting local elections.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Mr. Gerstell’s third and final point was that the federal government was a necessary,
    but not sufficient, participant in a unified cyber strategy. Indeed, when discussing
    how best to address the cyber threat, much importance had been given to the need
    for a whole-of-government approach. Yet, even at its most effective, the US government
    could not stand alone in securing the most critical systems while cyber vulnerabilities
    abound in other networks and systems not under government control. What was truly
    needed, he explained, could be more aptly described as a whole-of-users approach.
    Those users include, on one level or another, other nations, private-sector network
    owners, and even everyday citizen users of cyber technologies.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To date, the US government has played a leading role in defending against and
    responding to malicious international cyber activity, whether acting alone or
    in concert with close allies like the United Kingdom. The United States also employs
    non-cyber tools, such as sanctions, public attribution, criminal charges, and
    extradition, in its responses to such activity. It would be helpful if other nations
    recognized the global nature of the problem and took a multilateral approach to
    cyber threat response.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In general, the private sector is well aware of the seriousness of the cyber
    threat, and some industries, such as the financial and electronic sector, have
    invested significant time and resources into shoring up their critical components
    and networks. There are many individuals and small businesses, however, who might
    not have the resources to invest in upgrading and maintaining expensive equipment,
    or access to trained personnel who could provide cybersecurity services, or who
    might be confused by complicated cybersecurity guidance, or simply think that
    they are too small to be a target. However, some private network owners, including
    those who control critical infrastructure are too often willing to accept some
    security risks in their networks that would be unacceptable to the government.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In closing, Mr. Gerstell prophesized that the enormity of these challenges could
    not be overstated. Malefactors of cybercrime would, in all probability, be ever
    more successful before society would be able to blunt or negate this threat. But
    this very probability, the sheer foreseeability of possible and grave harm, underscores
    the need for society to do more to counter this almost existential threat. The
    chosen alternative has been to wait until one cyber incident after another forces
    the adoption of piecemeal solutions to what was actually an overarching issue
    that should be addressed through a comprehensive approach. He contended that the
    United States needed to own this problem that the people have created, and take
    aggressive steps to manage it before a calamity occurred. After all, with a tool
    as accessible, cost-effective, and easy to use as cyberspace, the United States
    just could not predict from which hot dog cart the next big attack would emerge.

    nationwide elder fraud sweep, claiming that the cases during this sweep involved
    more than 260 defendants from around the globe who victimized more than two million
    Americans, most of them elderly. The DOJ took action in every federal district
    across the country, through the filing of criminal or civil cases or through consumer
    education efforts. In each case, the offender(s) allegedly engaged in financial
    schemes that targeted or largely affected seniors. In total, the charged elder
    fraud schemes caused the alleged loss of millions of dollars. It is important
    to note that the charges are allegations, and the defendants are presumed innocent
    unless and until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law, and
    the actual amount of fraud will take several years to determine as the defendants
    go through the court system. As part of the sweep, the law enforcement partners
    announced a tech-support fraud takedown, designed to combat an increasingly common
    form of elder fraud in which criminals trick victims into giving remote access
    to their computers under the guise of providing technical support.
