- en: This chapter combines the topics, techniques, delivery options, and schedule
    discussed in previous chapters into three sample plans. Based on low, moderate,
    and high budget amounts, these plans serve as a foundation for organizations to
    build from. Additional awareness activities are reviewed that are applicable to
    any budget. Lastly, guidelines are provided for promoting the awareness program
    to the general employee population.

    Now, we'll explore some examples of using those building blocks to construct a
    complete program. The sample plans discussed are meant to provide you with a program
    baseline and can be tailored to fit the needs of your organization.

- en: This website should be the face of your awareness program. It should provide
    employees with a trusted resource for up-to-date information. Nobody wants to
    search through their e-mail for policies or procedures, especially when the website
    provides them with all of the resources they need [[1](#bb0010)]. At a minimum,
    content should include

    to be engaging to encourage employees to visit. Attention-grabbing headlines,
    topics, and graphics hold the reader's attention to the topic at hand [[2](#bb0015)].
    Including short security videos [[3](#bb0020)] or cartoons [[4](#bb0025)] create
    an attractive and education website. Work with your marketing and web development
    teams to streamline the visitor's experience. Most importantly, website content
    must be current to entice employees to visit frequently. Although you will want
    the website to be full of useful content, do not overload with extraneous material,
    as some employees will not be able to distinguish useful information from general
    information.

    largest factors in successfully utilizing posters are location and content. Place
    poster in high-traffic areas where they have the most visibility. Also, rotate
    the posters, both content and location placement to ensure that staff is continually
    reviewing the material. In doing this, you have a greater chance of staff members
    retaining the information on the posters. Additional information on posters is
    available in [Chapter 8](B9780124199675000089.xhtml). Other methods of keeping
    information fresh for staff member are to continually update the security awareness
    website and publish a monthly or quarterly newsletter on various security-related
    topics. These are effective ways of keeping security on the minds of employees.

    be informal—think more YouTube and less Hollywood—and only a minute or two long.
    Featuring employees in the video encourages everyone to participate. Introducing
    some humor in your videos can also encourage staff often to look forward to watching
    them, as it inspires camaraderie and helps staff relate to a topic. Also include
    a “suggestion box” e-mail account for employees to submit ideas for future content.

    staff members (under guidance and approval from the security team) can author
    session content for presentations. Speaking at these events is also a good way
    for those who wish to improve their public speaking skills. Another option is
    to watch a short video and hold a group discussion afterward. Begin with quarterly
    sessions, and add sessions based on popularity and volunteer presenters. Some
    examples of lunch and learn topics can be found in [Chapter 8](B9780124199675000089.xhtml).

    year. Open-source software is the cheapest option for implementing your own phishing
    assessment. The Social Engineering Toolkit (SET), as discussed in [Chapter 10](B9780124199675000107.xhtml),
    is a free tool for performing your own phishing assessment. SET requires basic
    Linux and Apache knowledge, so this task is best assigned to a technically skilled
    member of the security team. Ensure that results are stored in a spreadsheet or
    similar format for long-term tracking and comparison.

    Restricted Intelligence offers a comedy-based approach with a video series that
    teaches security basics with an entertaining twist. The campaign takes an approach
    similar to a television series where videos are released one at a time. Packages
    include posters, teaser video clips, and other resources to advertise the video
