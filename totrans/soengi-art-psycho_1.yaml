  zh: 第1章：什么是社会工程？
- en: Social engineering is a method of gaining access to systems, data, or buildings
    through the exploitation of the human psychology.  Instead of using technical
    techniques or breaking in, social engineering involves non-technical schemes that
    attackers employ.  For instance, an attacker may call a target or an employee
    and disguise as an IT support person instead of finding a software vulnerability
    in the target's company.  The attacker will then trick the target into giving
    his/her password.  The primary objective of social engineers is to gain the trust
    of as many targets as possible in a certain company.

  zh: 社会工程是通过利用人类心理学来获取系统、数据或建筑物的访问权限的一种方法。 社会工程不是使用技术手段或者闯入，而是利用攻击者采用的非技术方案。 例如，攻击者可以打电话给目标或员工，并冒充IT支持人员，而不是找到目标公司的软件漏洞。
    然后，攻击者会欺骗目标交出他/她的密码。 社会工程师的主要目标是在某家公司获得尽可能多的目标的信任。

    although the concept of tricking a person into divulging sensitive information
    has already been around for many years.

    Even if software vendors develop hardened and more difficult to break software
    systems, hackers are able to hit on them.  Network and software attack variables,

    ploys.  They may also say negative statements regarding the organization or management
    so that co-workers would sympathize with them once they are caught committing
    their misdeeds.  For instance, disgruntled employees may say that the top management
    is corrupt, unfair, or unappreciative and try to encourage other employees.  Once
    the disgruntled employees are caught, they would simply say that their misdeed
    is nothing compared to the inequity of the top management towards its employees.

    This personality is developed when an employee constantly complains about the
    workplace, co-employees, or the top management.  Eventually, this would lead them
