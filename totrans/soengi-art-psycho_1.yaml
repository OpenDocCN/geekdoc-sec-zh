- en: Social engineering is a method of gaining access to systems, data, or buildings
    through the exploitation of the human psychology.  Instead of using technical
    techniques or breaking in, social engineering involves non-technical schemes that
    attackers employ.  For instance, an attacker may call a target or an employee
    and disguise as an IT support person instead of finding a software vulnerability
    in the target's company.  The attacker will then trick the target into giving
    his/her password.  The primary objective of social engineers is to gain the trust
    of as many targets as possible in a certain company.

    Even if software vendors develop hardened and more difficult to break software
    systems, hackers are able to hit on them.  Network and software attack variables,
    including hacking, are fast becoming a part of social engineering skills.  More
    often than not, this type of social engineers use a combination of personal and
    hardware skills and use hacking in either minor or major breaches across the globe.

    call in sick, file leave of absence a lot, and go home on a half-day among others

    employees are inclined to initiating extra work, task, or duty, working for long

    fraud or scam, they are indeed disgruntled and likely to lead into social engineering
    ploys.  They may also say negative statements regarding the organization or management
    so that co-workers would sympathize with them once they are caught committing
    their misdeeds.  For instance, disgruntled employees may say that the top management
    is corrupt, unfair, or unappreciative and try to encourage other employees.  Once
    the disgruntled employees are caught, they would simply say that their misdeed
    is nothing compared to the inequity of the top management towards its employees.

    to become loners as they think, plan, and execute their crimes.  Again, these
    employees would often blame all their misdeeds to the organization or top management. 
    This personality is developed when an employee constantly complains about the
    workplace, co-employees, or the top management.  Eventually, this would lead them
    into thinking that they are alone, hence, becomes antisocial.  They become impersonal

    such lifestyle.  Furthermore, disgruntled employees who carry out social engineering
    ploys are primarily motivated by ego and money.

    items that are valuable to social engineers include passwords, keys, account numbers,
    access cards, identity badges, any personal information, details of computer systems,
    phone lists, information about non-public URLs, servers, intranet, servers, and
