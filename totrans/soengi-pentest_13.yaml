    the target company or even trick users into performing actions that lead to a
    full breach of their security. It is a popular attack vector as there is little
    risk of being identified and caught. This chapter provides a practical approach
    to planning the calls that will achieve the assessment objectives, but more importantly,
    identify the actual vulnerabilities in the target’s policies and procedures.

    example it was the Apple store in London. The scammer, posing as the Apple store
    staff member, informs the victim that somebody is currently in the store, trying
    to spend a large sum of money using what appears to be one of her cards. The victim
    checks to see if her cards are all present and finds that they are. The Apple
    store employee tells the victim that their card must have been cloned and that
    they should call their bank to have the cards canceled. At this point, the employee
    says the card cloner is running out of the store and puts the phone down, but
    doesn’t hang up. This keeps the call active, even if the victim hangs up at their
    end.

    do not realize that there was no dial tone. The attacker has remained on the line

    answers yes and asks how they can help.
  prefs: []

    her that under a new security scheme, she can cancel all cards assigned to her
    in one go, even those that do not belong to this particular bank. At this point,
    the attacker is playing on the victim’s fears. The victim literally can’t wait
    to get this issue resolve, so agrees to cancel all cards. She is next asked to
    dial her pin numbers into the telephone, all of which are recorded by the attacker.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    that a secure courier will be dispatched, same day, to collect the canceled cards
    and ensure they are disposed of properly. If the victim shows any resistance or
    claims she will cut them up herself, the attacker presses by saying that new cards
    cannot be issued until the old ones are collected. This is to ensure that they
    are not subject to further scams if they are recovered, such as identity fraud.

    it when they arrive. If they do not provide the correct number, they are to call

    the correct number to the victim. The victim’s hands over an envelope full of

    trying to establish the number of a switchboard or reception that can pass the
    call through to the target. Unfortunately, it is impossible to know what actually
    did show up unless you can gain information about the phone system during your
    reconnaissance phase and research its documentation. The intention behind getting
    an internal user to pass the call through with their ID is to exploit the chain
    of authentication. This is where the user thinks “Jane passed that call through
    and told me it is bob, so it must be bob.” You have assumed that another person
    has authenticated the caller, and it is more likely that they have not!

    point to make on this front, always have something waiting in the wings for when
    a piece of information is refused. It might just be that the staff member doesn’t
    know the answer, in which case your backup would be “*Could you find out who would
    know?*” At this point, they may disclose another name and contact number. Then
    the subsequent call can include the name dropping of Sarah—“*Hi, I was just speaking
    to Sarah and she said you would be able to….*” The frequent assumption is that
    Sarah has verified the caller. Again, this technique is abusing the chain of authentication.

    Having done some homework allows the consultant to ask for the person directly
    at this point. Try beginning with going into the details of a great offer on antivirus
    software and ask them if it is something they are looking to address in the short
    term. Often people have been heard to answer straight up with “*We use McAfee
    and the license has 2 years left to run on it*” but also get people who just say
    they already have it and that they aren’t interested. There is nothing to stop
    you pushing for more information though, a simple “*Do you mind me asking which
    antivirus it is that you currently use?*” Most sales guys will try this anyway
    so that they can attempt to pit their product against the embedded competitor,
    so it would not sound out of place. In a real-world engagement, this information

    antivirus. A practical tip here would be to install it in a virtual machine and

    damaged in this attack vector. Damaged means that the serial number can still
    be read, from the device. Telling them the device has been stolen means they are
    very likely to lock the account and reset the password to avoid compromise. It

    the network. It is also likely that the consultant will be able to talk should

    to identify that the site does not have its own IT staff. For example, why not
    try the “*I’m away for a couple of weeks and need to get a guy out there to upgrade
    some of the switches*” line. Then just tell the reception staff when you will
    be arriving and to have the passes ready. Worst-case scenario is that they ask
    for further authorization, at which point you can ask to speak to their supervisor
    and put further pressure on them. I know we mention meeting rooms an awful lot,

    have to have practical and actionable outcomes. You might not always be testing
    the physical security of an organization, but need to compromise a host within
    the network from the outside. I’m sure there are a number of ways to perform this,
    but this is one of the favorites.

- en: First of all, a Wireless Pineapple from Hak5 and a laptop with a packet injection
    capable WiFi adapter is required. There are many wireless adapters with Atheros
    chipsets, which support this functionality, such as either an Alfa or a TP-Link
    722n. The nice thing about the TP-Link is that they are easily available on Amazon
    and currently in the UK cost just over £8\. They are basically giving them away!
    One other important item required is a sign-off to DoS the wireless access points.
    This in itself may be a show stopper, but it’s a realistic concept that even moderately
    technical attackers could implement.

    3](CHP003.xhtml). Sabotage and assist, as its name implies, is the act of breaking
    something and then using that as a pretext to help somebody out and fix the issue.
    It is even possible to social engineer a third party to break something and then
    make the call claiming to be in a position to help. Whichever way this is looked
    at, it’s an effective technique.

- en: Basically, it’s a case of performing a wireless de-authentication attack against
    the wireless network at random intervals, disrupting communications for all who
    are connected to it. After several cycles through this process, the target is
    called, impersonating the help desk staff. The target is informed that everybody
    in their department is dropping off the network at random intervals and ask if
    they had noticed any issues. Even if the target didn’t, somebody around them is
    very likely to have noticed. If not, keep calling through to other numbers until
    someone is found.

    up to resolve the issue and talk them through the process of connecting to it.
    Of course, the wireless network they are connecting to is a hostile WiFi pineapple
    or similar rogue device. Now all the traffic can be intercepted, from the client
    to any destination.

    of this type. Configure an SSID and when a client connects, all DNS traffic is
    intercepted and the target routed to malicious pages of choice instead of their
    own internal resources.

    see this allowed so that laptop users can connect to their home networks or at
    various locations when on the road. If they can’t set up a new wireless network,
    you could have a fallback of a credential harvesting site available and ready
    to go. Always have a backup plan!

    of the chapter, hopefully giving some ideas and inspirations for future engagements,
    or for self-defensive education. Whichever side of the fence a reader may sit,
    they should now be better prepared for these attacks.

    information gathering in many ways and obtaining key pieces of information, again
