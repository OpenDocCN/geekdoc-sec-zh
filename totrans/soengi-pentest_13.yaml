    checks to see if her cards are all present and finds that they are. The Apple
    store employee tells the victim that their card must have been cloned and that
    they should call their bank to have the cards canceled. At this point, the employee

    call through to the target. Unfortunately, it is impossible to know what actually
    did show up unless you can gain information about the phone system during your
    reconnaissance phase and research its documentation. The intention behind getting
    an internal user to pass the call through with their ID is to exploit the chain
    of authentication. This is where the user thinks “Jane passed that call through
    and told me it is bob, so it must be bob.” You have assumed that another person
    has authenticated the caller, and it is more likely that they have not!

  zh: 值得注意的一个有趣点是，并非所有的电话系统在呼叫转移时都会传递来电显示。在一些较旧的系统中，将呼叫转移给他人时，来电显示可能会显示转移者的信息。因此，值得尝试确认一下能够将呼叫传递给目标的总机或前台的号码。不幸的是，除非你在侦察阶段获取了有关电话系统的信息并研究了其文档，否则不可能知道实际显示了什么。让内部用户使用他们的
    ID 将呼叫传递的意图是利用认证链。这就是用户的想法：“简传递了那个电话，并告诉我是鲍勃，所以肯定是鲍勃。” 你已经假设了另一个人已经对来电者进行了认证，但更有可能是他们没有！

    could at the very least get the consultants beyond the security-controlled doors
    and into a restricted area. The same concept applies to organizations that handle

    the main help desk and ask to speak to somebody in charge of IT related acquisitions.
    Having done some homework allows the consultant to ask for the person directly
    at this point. Try beginning with going into the details of a great offer on antivirus
    software and ask them if it is something they are looking to address in the short
    term. Often people have been heard to answer straight up with “*We use McAfee
    and the license has 2 years left to run on it*” but also get people who just say
    they already have it and that they aren’t interested. There is nothing to stop
    you pushing for more information though, a simple “*Do you mind me asking which
    antivirus it is that you currently use?*” Most sales guys will try this anyway
    so that they can attempt to pit their product against the embedded competitor,
    so it would not sound out of place. In a real-world engagement, this information
    could be used to prepare payloads that may be more likely to get around the target’s
    antivirus. A practical tip here would be to install it in a virtual machine and
    then test various combinations until something is found that works. It’s always

    and security guards. Again, the objective here is to find out what they currently
    have, and if there are any gaps in coverage. Once again, if they respond with
    “*sorry we already have xyz*” push for the name of the vendor or systems in use.
    If they provide the name of the security firm that currently manages the building,

    domain within the time frame. The only remaining option was to hope that the targets
    mail client didn’t display the actual e-mail address, instead showing the ‘name’
    of the sender. Using a standard free mail account, making sure the “mail from”
    name showed as Jane Rogers. An authorization e-mail was created, along with contact
    instructions and a mobile number. Added to this was a forged e-mail signature
    that had been recovered during the reconnaissance phase. Another call was placed
    to the help desk, to let the technician know that there should be a mail waiting
    for him from Jane, even though it was known that it hadn’t been sent it at this
    point. Periodically, further calls were made with each one gradually sounding
    more and more flustered and irritated, each time ensuring to mention the name
    Jane Rogers. Persistently insisting that Jane had said that she had sent the e-mail
    several times. Some time later, the message was sent. Eventually, the long awaited
    call was received. The support technician walked through the process of logging
    into the account with a new password.

    into doing things they may not normally do. The technique of “pressure and solution”
    was covered in more detail in [Chapter 3](CHP003.xhtml). If the e-mail had been
    sent straight away, the mission may still have been successful, but the first
    approach tends to be the most successful and more stable. In total, there were
    somewhere in the region of around six calls during the day speaking to the individual
    in support, and by this point the engineer was on first name terms. Resulting
    in the support technician appearing to be relieved at finally being able to help
    with the problem.

    of a job well done, it’s not fun exploiting a hard working guy like this. For
    this reason, it is always important to emphasize that the issue here was not how
    the call was dealt with. The issue was that the employers had not provided the
    necessary tools to perform this role in a secure manner. The improvement of this
    situation should be the ultimate goal of any engagement.

    that the Blackberry had been lost, stolen, or damaged beyond repair, and that
    access to the e-mails was urgently required. In this pretext, it could also be
    forgiven for not knowing how to access e-mail remotely, and therefore not knowing
    the URL for OWA. The recommended option is to go with lost or stolen, rather than
    damaged in this attack vector. Damaged means that the serial number can still
    be read, from the device. Telling them the device has been stolen means they are
    very likely to lock the account and reset the password to avoid compromise. It
    also means the victim may well have their device wiped. These are all things worth
    bearing in mind before carrying out this attack.

    cases, the VPN may also authenticate against the domain, so if you have managed
    to reset one, you may be able to access everything with the same credentials.
    VPN access is probably the ultimate goal if you are working remotely. It will
    be identical to being sat on their physical network. At this point, the test comes
    back more toward traditional penetration testing.

    won’t be turning up completely unannounced, as a lot of the groundwork first and

    a number of engagements. Typically, this approach would be used in shorter engagements,
    the type that lasts 1 or 2 days in total. There isn’t a lot of room for maneuver
    here, so the typical approach would be a day of reconnaissance and a day on-site.

    Maybe its success is directly related to the number of days an engagement lasts.
    Less days equals less investment, in this aspect of security, so maybe the organizations
    are trying to understand the issues that could be deemed low hanging fruit? This
    approach certainly attacks the obvious avenues. A client may want to understand
    the bigger issues, fix them, educate, and then reassess. Eventually, less obvious
    issues will be sought that potentially take more time to test.

    and staff that are away on vacation should have been identified. All of these
    pieces of intelligence come into play during the scenario. Calling in to a regional

    a reasonable story for attending the regional office and needing access. How about
    somebody working in IT attending site to do some maintenance and upgrades? This
    would give a solid reason for being there, as well as plausibility for accessing
    the network. It is also likely that the consultant will be able to talk should
    they come up against inquisitive staff members. Again, preparation work is needed
    to identify that the site does not have its own IT staff. For example, why not
    try the “*I’m away for a couple of weeks and need to get a guy out there to upgrade
    some of the switches*” line. Then just tell the reception staff when you will
    be arriving and to have the passes ready. Worst-case scenario is that they ask
    for further authorization, at which point you can ask to speak to their supervisor
    and put further pressure on them. I know we mention meeting rooms an awful lot,
    but once you have your foot in the door with the passes, get the receptionist
    to book out a room for you. It will give you somewhere to work from where you
    are unlikely to be challenged. It really takes the pressure off and you can continue
    with your objectives, in relative peace.

    capable WiFi adapter is required. There are many wireless adapters with Atheros
    chipsets, which support this functionality, such as either an Alfa or a TP-Link
    722n. The nice thing about the TP-Link is that they are easily available on Amazon
    and currently in the UK cost just over £8\. They are basically giving them away!
    One other important item required is a sign-off to DoS the wireless access points.

    called, impersonating the help desk staff. The target is informed that everybody
    in their department is dropping off the network at random intervals and ask if
    they had noticed any issues. Even if the target didn’t, somebody around them is
    very likely to have noticed. If not, keep calling through to other numbers until
