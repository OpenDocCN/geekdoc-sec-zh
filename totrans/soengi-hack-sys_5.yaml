    and 1930s when Russia created an enormous apparatus of whole organizations, overt

    the major powers of Europe and the United States. After the Second World War,
    Russia used this apparatus to be able to influence the politics of Europe. They
    had also used it during the war to help them, and sometimes the United States,
    in fighting the Nazis and the Italian fascists. But in a major way, they were
    also preparing for being able to influence the outcome of the struggle for the
    balance of power in Europe following the Second World War.

    democratic and liberal parties in both Europe and the United States,. In fact,
    they were able to take advantage of the fact that the United States was friendly
    and that they and Russia were working together. The Russians used their apparatus,
    which has been up since the 1920s, to achieve political goals in the late 1970s
    and 1980s. Since then, they have modernized this apparatus and are spending billions
    of dollars a year extending it, with a possible 10,000 to 15,000 people involved

    operations and their proxies intervened in the election in 2016, and it was the

    a great decade for the West. For Russian leaders and many regular Russians, the
    dominance of the West came at the expense of Russia’s loss in the Cold War. But
    Russia would not remain weak and its economic recovery led to a return to a much
    more assertive and aggressive posture on the world stage, as was seen in the crushing
    of Georgia in 2008, in the annexation of Crimea in 2014, and currently in the
    ongoing war in Eastern Ukraine. For the West, Russia’s return to the world stage
    has been nothing more than pure revanchism. For Russia, it is restoring some balance
    in their relationship with the West. The narrative of restoring the balance, correcting
    the injustice and the distortions of the 1990s, has been absolutely essential
    to Russian propaganda since the beginning of the Putin era.

    discussed a petition that appeared on the WhiteHouse.gov website in April of 2014

    norm, this petition was different, having gained more than 39,000 online signatures
    in a short period. An examination of those signing and posting on this petition
    showed that it appeared to be the work of bots. A closer look at those bots tied
    in closely with other social media campaigns pushing Russian propaganda months

    Cold War through the force of politics, as opposed to the politics of force. While
    Russia certainly sought to promote Western candidates sympathetic to their worldview

    means to create enduring change in American politics. It was for this reason Mr.
    Bannon engaged SCL, a military contractor, to build an arsenal of informational
    weapons he could deploy on the American population. Mr. Bannon wanted to use the

    was originally conducted by psychologists at the University of Cambridge. It should
    be noted that some of the profiling research used as the basis of CA operations
    had declared funding from the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA).
    The purpose of Ripon was to develop and scale psychological profiling algorithms
    for use in American political campaigns. To be clear, the work of CA and SCL is
    not equivalent to traditional marketing, as has been claimed by some. This false
    equivalence is misleading. CA specialized in disinformation, spreading rumors,

    vulnerabilities in certain subsets of the American population and worked to exploit
    those vulnerabilities by targeting information designed to activate some of the
    worst characteristics in people, such as neuroticism, paranoia, and racial biases.
    This was targeted at narrow segments of the population. The Russian-American researcher
    Dr. Aleksandr Kogan was selected to lead the data harvesting operation, as he
    offered the use of Facebook apps that he had developed in his academic role in
    order to collect personal data about Facebook users and their friends. Mr. Wylie
    later learned that Dr. Kogan did not have permission from Facebook to exploit
    the apps’ privileged access for commercial or political activities. This has been
    confirmed in legal correspondence with Facebook. Dr. Kogan developed data harvesting
    applications that would capture not only the original app user but would harvest
    all the personal data of that user’s Facebook friends and connections without
    their knowledge or explicit consent.

    Kogan博士被选为领导数据收集行动的人员，因为他提供了在学术角色中开发的Facebook应用程序，以收集关于Facebook用户及其朋友的个人数据。后来，Wylie先生得知，Kogan博士未经Facebook的许可就利用了这些应用程序的特权访问进行商业或政治活动。这在与Facebook的法律函件中得到了确认。Kogan博士开发了数据收集应用程序，不仅可以捕获原始应用程序用户的数据，还会在没有他们的知识或明确同意的情况下收集该用户的Facebook朋友和联系人的所有个人数据。
- en: As Facebook has now confirmed, over 80 million data subjects, many of whom were
    American citizens, had their personal data misappropriated in the Ripon program.
    Given this scale, Ripon could be one of the largest breaches of Facebook data.
    CA often stored or transmitted data in insecure formats, including files of hundreds
    of thousands of Americans’ data being passed around via unencrypted emails. CA
    also allowed access to its American datasets to external contractors, including
    senior staff from the company Palantir, which is a contractor to the US National
    Security Agency (NSA). Palantir denies having any formal relationship with CA

    triad traits of narcissism, Machiavellianism, and psychopathy. The Russian project
    also conducted behavioral research on online trolling. It should be noted that

    General Rod J. Rosenstein commented that this indictment serves as a reminder
    that people are not always who they appear to be on the Internet. The indictment
    alleged that the Russian conspirators wanted to promote discord in the United
    States and undermine public confidence in democracy. Rosenstein also said that
    the DOJ received exceptional cooperation from private sector companies like Facebook,
    Oath, PayPal, and Twitter.

    of accounts on social media networks such as Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter,
    making it appear as if the accounts were controlled by persons within the United
    States. They used stolen or fictitious American identities, fraudulent bank accounts,

    to oppose him, both in New York, on the same day. On September 13, 2017, soon
    after the news media reported that the Special Counsel’s Office was investigating

    disinformation operations. Conspirators included a Russian Intelligence close
    access hacking team that traveled abroad to compromise computer networks used
    by anti-doping and sporting officials and organizations investigating Russia’s
    use of chemical weapons. A grand jury in the Western District of Pennsylvania

    interest to the Russian government. Among the goals of the conspiracy was to publicize
    stolen information as part of an influence and disinformation campaign designed
    to undermine, retaliate against, and otherwise delegitimize the efforts of international
    anti-doping organizations and officials who had publicly exposed a Russian ­state-sponsored

    GRU technical intelligence officers, including Morenets, Serebriakov, Sotnikov,

    in Russia, including Yermakov, these close access teams hacked computer networks
    used by victim organizations or their personnel through Wi-Fi connections, including
