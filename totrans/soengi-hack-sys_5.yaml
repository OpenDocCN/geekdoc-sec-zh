    of social media for foreign organizations to influence the outcome of the 2016
    and 2018 elections in the US and 2019 in Europe. There is little doubt that Russian
    organizations and perhaps those of other nations have indeed used social media
    to attempt to influence elections. [Chapter 1](chapter1.xhtml#chapter1) provides
    a brief overview of the testimony of social media executives before the US Congress.
    This chapter examines the activities of foreign players as well as domestic organizations
    and individuals’ using social engineering to influence election outcomes.

    and 1930s when Russia created an enormous apparatus of whole organizations, overt
    and covert, throughout the world; organizations that were able to challenge all
    the major powers of Europe and the United States. After the Second World War,
    Russia used this apparatus to be able to influence the politics of Europe. They
    had also used it during the war to help them, and sometimes the United States,
    in fighting the Nazis and the Italian fascists. But in a major way, they were
    also preparing for being able to influence the outcome of the struggle for the
    balance of power in Europe following the Second World War.

    democratic and liberal parties in both Europe and the United States,. In fact,
    they were able to take advantage of the fact that the United States was friendly
    and that they and Russia were working together. The Russians used their apparatus,
    which has been up since the 1920s, to achieve political goals in the late 1970s
    and 1980s. Since then, they have modernized this apparatus and are spending billions
    of dollars a year extending it, with a possible 10,000 to 15,000 people involved
    worldwide, in addition to the trolls and other kinds of cyber capabilities they

    presentation with a similar analysis, asserting that the Russian use of active
    measures and their interference in the US presidential campaign were the most
    contentious issues in our national conversation. He believed that Russian intelligence
    operations and their proxies intervened in the election in 2016, and it was the
    totality of Russian efforts in plain sight to mislead, misinform, and exaggerate
    that was more convincing than any cyber evidence. Russia Today (RT) broadcasts,
    Internet trolls, and fake news are an integral part of modern Russian foreign
    policy. Their content is designed to appeal to domestic anti-social groups and

    a great decade for the West. For Russian leaders and many regular Russians, the
    dominance of the West came at the expense of Russia’s loss in the Cold War. But
    Russia would not remain weak and its economic recovery led to a return to a much
    more assertive and aggressive posture on the world stage, as was seen in the crushing
    of Georgia in 2008, in the annexation of Crimea in 2014, and currently in the
    ongoing war in Eastern Ukraine. For the West, Russia’s return to the world stage
    has been nothing more than pure revanchism. For Russia, it is restoring some balance
    in their relationship with the West. The narrative of restoring the balance, correcting
    the injustice and the distortions of the 1990s, has been absolutely essential
    to Russian propaganda since the beginning of the Putin era.

    discussed a petition that appeared on the WhiteHouse.gov website in April of 2014
    entitled Alaska Back to Russia. It appeared as a public campaign to give America’s
    largest state back to the nation from which it was purchased. Even though satirical
    or nonsensical petitions appearing on the White House website are not out of the
    norm, this petition was different, having gained more than 39,000 online signatures
    in a short period. An examination of those signing and posting on this petition
    showed that it appeared to be the work of bots. A closer look at those bots tied
    in closely with other social media campaigns pushing Russian propaganda months
    before. Hackers proliferated on the networks and could be spotted among recent
    data breaches and website defacements. Closely circling those hackers were honeypot

    appearing from difficult geographic locations and communities, amplified the fake
    news story in unison. The hashtags pushed by these accounts were nuclear, media,

    schemes. All social engineers take advantage of a social context that is comprised
    of people’s beliefs, attitudes, living conditions, expectations, and desires,
    among other countless factors. The skilled social engineer is able to craft a
    message that appeals to large populations, specific subpopulations, or even smaller
    groups. That is an ongoing process in social engineering. Then social engineers
    can readily play on the efforts of other social engineers by copycatting the already

    of migrants were traveling from Central America through Mexico to the southern
    US border, one of the fear-generating themes was that the caravans were full of
    terrorists that wanted to enter the United States to kill its citizens and damage
    the country. Thus, this socially engineered position on part of the wall supporters

- en: In the realm of politics, social engineers want to influence the outcome of
    elections and thus their primary goal is to convince people to vote in a particular
    manner. Since the 2016 election in the United States, there have been numerous
    congressional hearings addressing how social media was used to influence the election.
    (See [Chapter 1](chapter1.xhtml#chapter1) for an overview of what Facebook reported
    to Congress.) It is likely that these hearings and investigations will continue.
    The statements to the US Senate Committee on The Judiciary in The Matter of Cambridge
    Analytica, by Mr. Christopher Wylie in May 2018, provide considerable insight
    into the social engineering methods that have come to light as a result of the
    scandal. Mr. Wylie was the Director of Research for the SCL Group and Cambridge
    Analytica (CA) from mid-2013 to late 2014\. The SCL Group was a UK-based military
    contractor that worked for the US and UK militaries and also worked at the NATO
    StratCom Centre in the Baltic region. He told the US Congress several alarming
    things.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First, Cambridge Analytica was created by the SCL Group with funding from Robert
    Mercer, an American billionaire based in New York. Robert Mercer installed Steve
    Bannon as CA’s vice president, with responsibilities to manage the company day-to-day.
    Mr. Bannon was a follower of the Breitbart Doctrine, which posits that politics
    flows downstream from culture. Therefore, Mr. Bannon saw cultural warfare as the
    means to create enduring change in American politics. It was for this reason Mr.
    Bannon engaged SCL, a military contractor, to build an arsenal of informational
    weapons he could deploy on the American population. Mr. Bannon wanted to use the
    same kinds of information operations tactics used by the military for his political
    aims in the United States and elsewhere. CA was created as the ­front-facing American
    brand to allow SCL to work in the United States.

    formally warned about the implications of using foreign citizens in US elections
    in a legal memorandum, the firm disregarded this advice and proceeded to install
    Alexander Nix, a British national resident in London, as CEO, and sent non-US
    citizens to play strategic roles embedded in American campaigns.

- en: While at SCL and CA, Mr. Wylie said he was made aware of the firm’s black ops
    capacity, which he understood to include using hackers to break into computer
    systems to acquire kompromat (compromising material) or other intelligence for
    its clients. The firm referred to these operations as special intelligence services
    or special information technology (IT) services. He also said he had seen documents
    relating to several instances where SCL or CA procured hacked material for the
    benefit of its clients. Some of the targets of these intelligence operations are
    currently heads of state in various countries.

    and Julian Assange. The firm hired two senior staff, both of whom were previously
    aides to John Jones QC in London. Mr. Jones was the British lawyer who represented
    Julian Assange, Wikileaks, and members of the Gaddafi regime. He later killed
    himself when he jumped in front of a train in 2016\. Although the firm claimed
    only brief contact with Mr. Assange, recordings of SCL Group’s former CEO suggest
    that contact with Wikileaks began 18 months prior to the US election.

    Ripon. This project was overseen by Mr. Bannon and was based upon research that
    was originally conducted by psychologists at the University of Cambridge. It should
    be noted that some of the profiling research used as the basis of CA operations
    had declared funding from the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA).
    The purpose of Ripon was to develop and scale psychological profiling algorithms
    for use in American political campaigns. To be clear, the work of CA and SCL is
    not equivalent to traditional marketing, as has been claimed by some. This false
    equivalence is misleading. CA specialized in disinformation, spreading rumors,
    kompromat, and propaganda. Using machine-learning algorithms, CA worked on moving
    these tactics beyond its operations in Africa or Asia and into American cyberspace.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Mr. Wylie continued by explaining that CA sought to identify mental and emotional
    vulnerabilities in certain subsets of the American population and worked to exploit
    those vulnerabilities by targeting information designed to activate some of the
    worst characteristics in people, such as neuroticism, paranoia, and racial biases.
    This was targeted at narrow segments of the population. The Russian-American researcher
    Dr. Aleksandr Kogan was selected to lead the data harvesting operation, as he
    offered the use of Facebook apps that he had developed in his academic role in
    order to collect personal data about Facebook users and their friends. Mr. Wylie
    later learned that Dr. Kogan did not have permission from Facebook to exploit
    the apps’ privileged access for commercial or political activities. This has been
    confirmed in legal correspondence with Facebook. Dr. Kogan developed data harvesting
    applications that would capture not only the original app user but would harvest
    all the personal data of that user’s Facebook friends and connections without
    their knowledge or explicit consent.

    American citizens, had their personal data misappropriated in the Ripon program.
    Given this scale, Ripon could be one of the largest breaches of Facebook data.
    CA often stored or transmitted data in insecure formats, including files of hundreds
    of thousands of Americans’ data being passed around via unencrypted emails. CA
    also allowed access to its American datasets to external contractors, including
    senior staff from the company Palantir, which is a contractor to the US National
    Security Agency (NSA). Palantir denies having any formal relationship with CA
    and states this work was apparently done in a personal capacity.

    psychological profiling. The Russian project had a particular focus on the dark
    triad traits of narcissism, Machiavellianism, and psychopathy. The Russian project
    also conducted behavioral research on online trolling. It should be noted that
    CA was very much aware of this work going on in Russia, and in fact it sought
    to pitch the interesting work Alex Kogan had been doing for the Russians to its
    other clients. Box 6.3 summarizes CA research management activities.

    for a scheme to interfere in the US political system, including the 2016 presidential
    election, using social engineering and other methods. The indictment was presented

    distrust toward the candidates and the political system in general. Deputy Attorney
    General Rod J. Rosenstein commented that this indictment serves as a reminder
    that people are not always who they appear to be on the Internet. The indictment

    network. The defendants allegedly used that infrastructure to establish hundreds
    of accounts on social media networks such as Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter,

    States. They used stolen or fictitious American identities, fraudulent bank accounts,
