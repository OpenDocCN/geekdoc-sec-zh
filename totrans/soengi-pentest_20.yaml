    sheet and flowchart that helps a security engineer plan and perform a social engineering
    assessment. The flowchart will refer chapters of the book where the reader can
    gain further insight into the tools and techniques required and the aim is to
    provide an easy to use system based upon the methodology presented throughout
    the book.

    be used internally within a company as a method to raise security awareness and
    build stronger policies to hopefully prevent exposure from a real social engineering

    was loosely based on the Penetration Testing Execution Standard or PTES—[http://www.pentest-standard.org/index.php/Main_Page](http://www.pentest-standard.org/index.php/Main_Page).
    The idea of this framework is to provide structure to the planning and performing
    of a social engineering assessment to enable a repeatable standard to be adhered
    to by an organization performing such consultancy.'

- en: This initial section covers everything that happens before the engagement and
    looks at topics such as scoping, goals, establishing lines of communication, rules
    of engagement, and legal protections required as part of the engagement. Some
    of these concepts are covered in [Chapter 13](CHP013.xhtml).

- en: This section is the first section once the engagement is underway and covers
    the initial groundwork in uncovering information that can be leveraged as part
    of the social engineering assessment. Examples of information to be gathered can
    include gathering corporate email addresses from search engines and social networks,
    parsing document metadata from publicly available corporate documentation, and
    establishing contact details such as phone numbers for switchboards and receptions.
    This section is covered in detail in [Chapter 8](CHP008.xhtml).

    This model looks at the results of the initial information gathering and in combination
    with the requirements of the customer allows you to create a targeted attack scenario
    based upon a chosen attack vector. Although threat models use similar attack vectors
    the way they are designed and implemented are unique to each customer. Threat
    modeling is covered in [Chapter 6](CHP006.xhtml) and also [Chapter 7](CHP007.xhtml).

- en: This section covers the actual execution of the social engineering assessment
    that is considered as the primary objective of the engagement. This is where all
    of the information gathered is used against the threats that have been modeled
    in order to perform a threat-based assessment. The objective for the consultant
    is to gain access to the systems, or to break the procedures, that were identified
    in the earlier stages of the assessment. Information about executing such assessments
    through the three main attack vectors can be found in [Chapters 9](CHP009.xhtml)–[11](CHP011.xhtml).
    Further information about how these attack vectors can be supported through technology
    can be found in [Chapter 12](CHP012.xhtml).

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This section covers the secondary objective of the engagement which is possible
    only after the assessment has been successfully performed. For example, the primary
    objective may have been to gain physical access to the building, by tailgating,
    which was performed during the execution. The post-execution task and secondary
    objective may be to gather up sensitive information and exfiltrate without being
    caught or noticed. The social engineering aspects of post-execution are covered
    as above in [Chapters 9](CHP009.xhtml)–[12](CHP012.xhtml). Many post-execution
    tasks are network based and are outside the scope of this book as they are considered
    more in line with infrastructure penetration testing.

- en: Once the assessment is complete, the report is then created from the findings
    and results from executing the assessment. This is deliverable to the client and
    a very important piece of work that must meet the business objectives that drove
    the social engineering assessment in the first place. The report takes form of
    a written piece of work that includes all evidence gathered and methods used.
    It is normal that the report is collated and written by the consultant who performed
    the actual assessment. It is also advised to make the consultant available to
    present the findings verbally or at least be available for a conference call to
    answer any question that the client may have regarding the assessment that was
    performed. More information about gathering the information for and writing the
    actual report can be found in [Chapter 13](CHP013.xhtml).

    components may be added to the chart to create a more in-depth cheat sheet that
    summarizes and links to the key concepts provided in this book. This book has
    provided extensive chapter and page references in the flowchart so that enables
    cross referencing of the flowchart with sections of the book appertaining to the
    topic.

- en: This final chapter has provided a brief summary and an associated flowchart
    of the social engineering framework that was presented in [Chapter 5](CHP005.xhtml).
    Next, the flowchart was expanded to include more details under each section in
    an attempt to turn it more into a graphical representation of the major concepts
    covered within this book. It is hoped that this cheat sheet can act as a summary
    guide to relate the steps in the model to sections in the book for quick reference
    at a later date.
