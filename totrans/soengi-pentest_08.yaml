    on a day-to-day basis. This chapter will walk you through the process and associated
    challenges of engaging a third party to perform social engineering work. The challenges
    are how to manage the delivery of this work according to typically strict timelines

    social engineers use to obtain information and manipulate their target. The intention
    of this book is not to scare the reader into never answering a phone again, but
    if you aren’t at least a little concerned about your own posture, that of your
    business or even friends and family, then they probably should be. This leads
    smoothly into the present chapter, where the topic of how you would go about identifying
    these very same flaws in your own people and processes will be covered.

- en: The business need for social engineering can be rooted in a multitude of different
    drivers. One thing is for certain; most businesses will completely overlook social
    engineering when it comes to allocating their security budget. Instead they will
    choose to focus their efforts around traditional security services and products,
    such as firewalls, IPS, and anti-virus. While each of these technologies clearly
    has a place in any modern environment, they can all be taken completely out of
    the equation by a motivated and devious social engineer. Why go over the mountain
    if it can be circumvented?
  prefs: []

    are ill-prepared to deal with malicious social engineers, which ultimately will
    mean data loss, embarrassment, or in the case of compliance, massive fines and
    increased workload for all involved.

    that it has often been difficult to get approval for large security spends, especially
    in comparison to infrastructure and software budgets. Security was always seen
    as the insurance policy that never made any return, and for that reason was left
    in a state of neglect.

    that a virus or hack could, and will likely go completely unnoticed. Organizations

    data. While the testing procedures can be carried out by a PCI DSS Qualified Security
    Assessor (QSA), it could be argued that engaging with a social engineering consultant
    as a side project could provide more relevant and accurate results. As an example,
    it is almost always going to be the case that any visit to a particular business
    by a QSA will be known about by all of the technical staff. What the assessment
    is unlikely to address is what is happening during day-to-day operations. Granted,
    they may well pass the PCI assessment on that specific date but that does not
    mean that the organization will be protected from payment card security breaches
    for the remainder of the year. The QSA assessment is much like a Ministry of Transport
    test.^([1](#FN1))

    to be noncompliant postbreach. While compliance sets a bar for security, it is
    not wise to merely scrape over it and hope for the best. Consistent and proactive
    testing of the policies and procedures is the only way to ensure that all is being
    done to reduce the risk of a breach. Engaging a team of social engineers to attempt
    physical access on a regular basis will not only help to ensure that the security
    is working as advertised but can also be very useful when it comes to staff awareness
    and education.

    staff training and security awareness programs. The most relevant subsection for
    social engineers is 12.6\. Requirement 12.6 covers the development and delivery

- en: The real benefit of including social engineering, as a part of a staff awareness
    training, is IMPACT! Let’s be honest, the second PowerPoint is fired up, probably
    30% of the audience is lost. Unfortunately as PCI DSS tries to address the three
    arms of information security – technology, people, and process – having an ineffective
    security awareness program may meet the mandated annual awareness training, but
    it does not provide the most effective method of addressing the people factor.
    Therefore the best way to ensure that the training is “fit for purpose” is to
    make it relevant to the audience. If a person was to be asked if they could be
    duped out of sensitive information over the phone, they would not believe it possible.
    To them the principal is silly, does not affect them, and is therefore not relevant.

    to staff that an unauthorized individual gained physical access to the premises
    as a result of a few well-placed phone calls or that the same individual tailgated
    a member of staff into a secure area. Immediately the penny will start to drop.
    Yes these sorts of things can happen, and probably are happening all the time,
    but at this point there is likely to be an increase in the amount of people paying
    close attention to the slides, asking questions, and probably an increase in the
    worried looks on faces around the room. Each person is now wondering if they were
    responsible for allowing a tailgater into the building, or if they arranged for
    access over the phone.

    of Domain 9.1.2—for example, are they challenged as an unescorted visitor? Were
    they able to gain access to areas where sensitive information is stored or processed?
    If they remove their visitor badges, are they challenged by staff? How long does

    their expectations. Ideally, the client should undergo a consultation process

    a realistic threat model can be built, and from that, a realistic scope. The earlier
    the involvement in this process, the sooner any kinks can be ironed out that may

    just don’t have the budget to perform a thorough assessment. The challenge now
    becomes to identify as many potential issues as possible in the short time frame
    allowed. It is genuinely difficult to not compromise the ability to deliver a
    valuable service in these instances, and sometimes it is just better to walk away
    and maintain integrity. A frequent occurrence is when new projects are raised
    with half a day assigned to test the physical security of a site. These projects
    are typically tick-box exercises for the client who wants to know that someone
    cannot just walk in off the street. Unfortunately there is very little value in
    them for all involved, so do try to avoid being drawn down this path. The client’s
    time would be far better spent by having a member of the team on-site to give
    half a day’s training. In that time, they could cover off some of the more common
    attack types, give some real world examples, and finish off with some defense
    strategies.

    have quite a short turnaround time for completion. Often this is taken out of
    their hands for any number of reasons. Unfortunately this can result in them having
    to test several geographically separate sites back to back within a few days.
    There have been several instances where they have found that security at one site
    has tipped off security at the other sites, including descriptions of the social
    engineers that so callously violated them on the previous day. It is recommended
    to always try and persuade the customer to avoid back to back tests and instead
    spread them out over longer time frames. Where this is not possible, try to ensure
    that different testers and pretexts are used for each site. Don’t forget that
    just because the team didn’t get made on day 1, it doesn’t mean that they didn’t
    raise suspicions. The security team may have reviewed CCTV footage and decided
    they were up to no good. As a result, the security across the entire business
    is at DEFCON 1 and anything that is tried just isn’t going to stick.

    of the entire team being burnt as a result of consecutive tests. The chances of
    security being this coordinated across all sites are fairly slim. By the time

    how can they be expected to prevent them? There are some instances in which it
    is unavoidable to indirectly identify someone. The client will have a full timeline
    of events, so it is not a leap to find the security guard that was on the rota
    that day. Always try to steer the conversation down the road of education and

    of specifying a day (or days) for your visit, choose to give the client a window
    during which the breach will be attempted and that window could be weeks or even
    months in length. Not taking the time to explain the subtleties of social engineering

    some clients have stated that they didn’t feel that social engineering was a risk
    to them, because their staff would never give out sensitive information. This
    would usually result in them being asked to carry out a small challenge, and if
    it was met it then maybe they would consider further work down the line. As the
    client, they have the prerogative to flip this and challenge the vendor to see
    what they are made of. Ask them to find out some key pieces of information that

    The maximum penalty under conviction is a two-year imprisonment and a fine. Two

    off by the right people is so important. During a penetration test, staying within
    scope is a relatively straightforward affair. During social engineering engagements,
    the engineer won’t necessarily have been shown to the network point by their contact.
    As a result, the infrastructure that is being plugged into could belong to the
    people that manage the building that the client is in, and worse yet this may
    be on entirely the wrong floor and be plugging into another business network!
    This is where the time spent doing the reconnaissance is paramount to ensure that
    the engineer stays on the straight and narrow. Try and make sure that the client’s
    floor is identified and look for business identifiers before doing anything that

    engineering on several occasions, but I have to say, determining its relevance
    is quite difficult. For example, in private organizations the employer actually
    has the right to monitor what its staff are doing via various means, as long as
    it is stated in the employee contract or employee handbook. This can include CCTV,
    reading an employee’s email, or even bag searches. The employees have to be informed
    that this is happening in almost all cases and the employer has to have suitable
    cause to monitor. As far as the penetration testing section of a social engineering
    engagement goes, there are limited areas of risk. These areas almost always apply
    to the accidental interception of personal communications. This could happen if
    you were performing a Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) attack via ARP poisoning as an
    example. In my opinion, this is a massive stretch, and the reason I say this is
    that I would absolutely never ARP poison or MITM on a physical engagement where
    I had to gain access to a facility and then plug-in and “hack.” The best approach
    is to always try to avoid ARP poisoning on physical penetration tests. It can
    be massively disruptive. A social engineering engagement may need to move in a
    real hurry, disconnecting from whatever network point that is plugged into without
    gracefully ending whatever is being worked on. In the case of ARP poisoning or
    other MITM attacks, this is going to mean an outage for the client for however
    long the switches are configured to time out the ARP entries.

    The Karma attack is where an attacker/penetration tester listens for a client,
    which is probing for known wireless networks. The attacker responds to the client
    claiming to be that access point, at which point the client connects. The typical
    scenario here is to sit in the middle of this session, capturing passwords and
    other data, and forwarding any traffic out onto the Internet. This gives a seamless
    experience to the client who never even suspects that the attack has happened.

    deployed by the organization for guest access. There is likely to be nothing stopping
    corporate laptops and devices from connecting to open networks, meaning it could
    provide some especially useful information during a social engineering engagement.
    Coming back onto the topic of the Human Rights Act, the engineer will likely be
    capturing other users data throughout this entire attack, some of whom may not
    even be employed by the client.

    going to help too. Ensure that there is a signed off scope from a person in authority
    before accessing a computer so that the “without authorization” becomes a non-issue.
    The rest of the CFAA should not apply to a tester as it covers truly malicious
    acts, destructive, and otherwise.

    chapter has covered most of the laws that could apply to this profession each
    of which rely heavily on the unauthorized access aspect. Ensure that the task
    is signed off by a person who has the authority to do so, and then the scope is
    stuck to religiously. It is a good idea to raise any potential risks upfront so
    that the client is aware of any potential for legal ramifications.

    have been to gain physical access to the building by tailgating. The post execution
    task may be to gather up sensitive information and exfiltrate without being caught
    or noticed. It could be that the task is to connect to the network and enumerate
    as much information as possible from corporate hosts. The execution and post execution

    them as a business. That is not to say that customers shouldn’t be steered toward
    what would be more beneficial to them, after all, the social engineer is well
    experienced in this field. There will be more on this topic in [Chapter 6](CHP006.xhtml),
    which deals with effective threat modeling. In any case, this section would document
    what is required, including any special or custom requirements. This may include
    specific departments or resources to target. A good example often used is to attempt

    in different ways, and those methods must be accessible and understandable by
    staff at all levels within a business. The aim of any social engineer should be

    results of the assessment, along with a run through any evidence or collateral
    you have gathered. There have been several instances where during a social engineering
    engagement the engineers have gained physical access to a client site, and just
    turned up at their office for the debrief, or called them from one of their board
    room phones. While this kind of thing certainly adds impact to proceedings, there
    certainly is a need to know the audience before trying it. The last thing needed
    is to cause offense or appear to be showboating.

    throughout the assessment. Photographs and videos are always interesting to the
    client and can really emphasize the points being made. A detailed timeline of
    events is also crucial to the debrief. It is worth pointing out that gathering
    this evidence while performing the assessment can be very difficult, but certain
    types of technology, such as hidden cameras and microphones, can make it far easier.

    debriefed is understood. It is not uncommon for people to be shocked or even angry
    that they were breached and immediately start blame storming. The information
    has to be delivered with tact throughout the process. Avoid naming names or pointing
    fingers at individuals. Embarrassing or belittling people, even unintentionally,
    is not helpful to the process and is likely to cause resistance and resentment
    toward you and your findings. This is why splitting the deliverables between a
    debrief and a report works so well. The debrief allows the client to come to terms
    with what has happened, while explaining that the issues identified were procedural
    and not a fault of an individual, which is almost always true. By the time the
    written report arrives, likely a week later, things have settled down a little
    and the report can be looked upon in a more constructive manner.

    as a professional to ensure that the client does not go postal during the process.
    The only way to do this is to educate them as to the holes within their processes
    and procedures and not to look at these issues as individual mistakes, which they
    almost always are not.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    time should be dedicated toward addressing remediation. In the vast majority of

    improvements are made. The security as a lifecycle mentality works well here with
    constant re-education and re-testing contributing toward a far healthier posture.

    corporate information from publicly available document metadata. Metadata is included
    when a document is created, but is often hidden from the end user during the process.
    In this instance, the data recovered included usernames, email addresses and locally
    installed software packages. In the wrong hands, this kind of information can
    be exceptionally damaging. As an example, the email addresses gathered can be
    used in targeted attacks known as Phishing. Phishing, in its most basic form,
    is the process of targeting individuals within an organisation in the hope that
    they will click a malicious link within an Email, or open a malicious attachment.
    In this event, the user’s computer could be completely compromised, which could
    lead to the loss of sensitive corporate data. The system could then become a platform
    for further attacks against other systems within the network. The locally installed
    software packages information can also be used by allowing an attacker to target
    software packages that are known to be vulnerable.

    path for remediation. However this stopped short of recommending individual products
    for the cleaning of metadata, but this could go down to that level, if appropriate,
    as there are plenty of tools available. It also avoided getting too technical
    or using too much technical jargon at this stage. Further detail on each successful
    attack will be available further into the report. If a phishing attack was successful,
    reference the metadata issue as a starting point of the attack. Then include some
    screenshots of the email that was crafted, along with shots of the amount of clicks
    that it generated within the user base, the impact of that section of the report
    would be greatly increased. Having visual aids within a report makes a big difference
    for most readers, it really highlights the proof of concept and breaks up the
    wall of text that the report could otherwise become.

    to the building and need to retrieve data from the network. This role will be
    filled by a penetration tester, preferably one who can stay calm under pressure.
    Gaining access to systems is a completely different ball game when there are security
    guards looking for the engineers, or when there is a very restrictive time window
    to exfiltrate.

- en: A “burner” is a common term for a mobile phone that is used for shady business
    and cannot be traced to its actual owner by any means. As such, it can be disposed
    of without hesitation or guilt. The burner is the sacrificial lamb. It’s the team
    member that is sent in to carry out a high-risk exercise, accepting that there
    may well temporarily lose the individual when they get caught in the act. The
    implementation of this play is often needed because the hand has been forced,
    and there are no other ways to gain the required intel.

    into the fray for this task also. Distracting a set of guards and often receptionists
    can really open up doors for the rest of the team!

- en: The social engineer in the team is the person skilled in the art of manipulation,
    persuasion, and deception. Some people are lucky enough to have these skills come
    naturally to them. Others have picked them up throughout their careers in other
    roles. Sales people, for example, already apply the tricks of the trade without
    even realizing that it is social engineering! Listening to a sales person trying
    to get a receptionist or call center to pass their call through to a CTO or similar
    can be an eye opening experience. Regularly the sales team is asked to drop into
    this role and make calls as a part of our engagements.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As well as the supporting sales staff, there might be at least one dedicated
    social engineer on the team. It is most likely that he would spend the vast majority
    of his time on the phone trying to manipulate individuals into gaining entry for
    the generalists. Even though this is the case, never underestimate the power of
    face-to-face social engineering. People get calls they don’t want to deal with,
    or that seem suspicious all the time, but exposure to this in person is far rarer
    and as such can be more likely to work.

- en: The scout is responsible for all aspects of reconnaissance in the buildup and
    during the course of the engagement. This can range from gathering photographic
    evidence of the building and its security setup to establishing patrol times for
    guards. The scout will scope out entry and exit points, try to establish what
    door control mechanism is in use, and see if there is a particular time of day
    that may be more suited to the engagement. For example, if the plan is to tailgate
    the perimeter doors, the best time to do this is when the most people turn up
    to work. The more footfall there is through that door, the more opportunities
    there are to follow without looking too suspicious. There is nothing worse than
    standing around looking out of place waiting for someone to follow.

    of the office too. It is surprising how much useful information can be turned
    up on [images.google.com](http://www.images.google.com) and [maps.google.com](http://www.maps.google.com).
    In fact, it is common to find high-resolution pictures with ID badges in them
    using this technique. Google Maps can be used to scope out the physical location
    with a degree of accuracy, but should not be relied on exclusively. Street view
    is a particularly useful tool, which can help to identify entrances and exits,
    smoking areas, and security gates.

    This included a brief look at threat modeling, difficulties in time management,
    project management as well as ethical considerations. These topics were approached
    from the client’s perspective to try and help them identify the right people to
