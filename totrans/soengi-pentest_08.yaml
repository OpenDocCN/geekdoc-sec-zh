- en: Security issues within an organization extend far beyond the realms of firewalls
    and anti-virus, and into the weaknesses surrounding how your people conduct themselves
    on a day-to-day basis. This chapter will walk you through the process and associated
    challenges of engaging a third party to perform social engineering work. The challenges
    are how to manage the delivery of this work according to typically strict timelines
    while still setting and achieving realistic goals.

    social engineers use to obtain information and manipulate their target. The intention
    of this book is not to scare the reader into never answering a phone again, but
    if you aren’t at least a little concerned about your own posture, that of your
    business or even friends and family, then they probably should be. This leads
    smoothly into the present chapter, where the topic of how you would go about identifying
    these very same flaws in your own people and processes will be covered.

    engineering when it comes to allocating their security budget. Instead they will
    choose to focus their efforts around traditional security services and products,
    such as firewalls, IPS, and anti-virus. While each of these technologies clearly
    has a place in any modern environment, they can all be taken completely out of

    as a side project could provide more relevant and accurate results. As an example,
    it is almost always going to be the case that any visit to a particular business
    by a QSA will be known about by all of the technical staff. What the assessment
    is unlikely to address is what is happening during day-to-day operations. Granted,
    they may well pass the PCI assessment on that specific date but that does not
    mean that the organization will be protected from payment card security breaches

    to be noncompliant postbreach. While compliance sets a bar for security, it is
    not wise to merely scrape over it and hope for the best. Consistent and proactive
    testing of the policies and procedures is the only way to ensure that all is being
    done to reduce the risk of a breach. Engaging a team of social engineers to attempt
    physical access on a regular basis will not only help to ensure that the security
    is working as advertised but can also be very useful when it comes to staff awareness
    and education.

    arms of information security – technology, people, and process – having an ineffective
    security awareness program may meet the mandated annual awareness training, but
    it does not provide the most effective method of addressing the people factor.
    Therefore the best way to ensure that the training is “fit for purpose” is to
    make it relevant to the audience. If a person was to be asked if they could be
    duped out of sensitive information over the phone, they would not believe it possible.

    of not naming and shaming individuals, even though this is very frequently requested.
    When a client has the circumstances explained to them, they will often find that
    they too would have probably fallen foul of the same tricks. If an employee has
    not been educated in how to identify and defend against social engineering attacks,
    how can they be expected to prevent them? There are some instances in which it
    is unavoidable to indirectly identify someone. The client will have a full timeline
    of events, so it is not a leap to find the security guard that was on the rota
    that day. Always try to steer the conversation down the road of education and
    training, not punishment. The security guard that just got duped is far less likely
    to let it happen again anytime soon!

    point of view that most people would probably overlook. This is simply that the
    client shouldn’t always be told what days the team will be on-site. This will
    be a foreign concept to project managers whose day-to-day job is to ensure smooth
    delivery of services to a client and to maintain seamless communication. Instead
    of specifying a day (or days) for your visit, choose to give the client a window
    during which the breach will be attempted and that window could be weeks or even
    months in length. Not taking the time to explain the subtleties of social engineering
    engagements to the members of the team often leads to the inevitability that the
    cover will be blown. Always ensure that the education about social engineering
    takes place within the social engineer’s business as well as your clients.

    client, they have the prerogative to flip this and challenge the vendor to see

    The maximum penalty under conviction is a two-year imprisonment and a fine. Two
    years in jail! Now it is starting to become apparent why getting the scope signed
    off by the right people is so important. During a penetration test, staying within
    scope is a relatively straightforward affair. During social engineering engagements,
    the engineer won’t necessarily have been shown to the network point by their contact.
    As a result, the infrastructure that is being plugged into could belong to the
    people that manage the building that the client is in, and worse yet this may
    be on entirely the wrong floor and be plugging into another business network!
    This is where the time spent doing the reconnaissance is paramount to ensure that
    the engineer stays on the straight and narrow. Try and make sure that the client’s
    floor is identified and look for business identifiers before doing anything that
    may mean that any law infringements take place.

    assessment, but what about the misidentified host scenario from Section 1? What
    if an engineer mistakenly plugs into somebody else’s network point and hacks their
    way onto a server? What if they then use information from that server, such as
    hashed credentials, to access other systems on the network further down the line?

- en: I have seen Article 8 mentioned in relation to penetration testing and social
    engineering on several occasions, but I have to say, determining its relevance
    is quite difficult. For example, in private organizations the employer actually
    has the right to monitor what its staff are doing via various means, as long as
    it is stated in the employee contract or employee handbook. This can include CCTV,
    reading an employee’s email, or even bag searches. The employees have to be informed
    that this is happening in almost all cases and the employer has to have suitable
    cause to monitor. As far as the penetration testing section of a social engineering
    engagement goes, there are limited areas of risk. These areas almost always apply
    to the accidental interception of personal communications. This could happen if
    you were performing a Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) attack via ARP poisoning as an
    example. In my opinion, this is a massive stretch, and the reason I say this is
    that I would absolutely never ARP poison or MITM on a physical engagement where
    I had to gain access to a facility and then plug-in and “hack.” The best approach
    is to always try to avoid ARP poisoning on physical penetration tests. It can
    be massively disruptive. A social engineering engagement may need to move in a
    real hurry, disconnecting from whatever network point that is plugged into without
    gracefully ending whatever is being worked on. In the case of ARP poisoning or
    other MITM attacks, this is going to mean an outage for the client for however
    long the switches are configured to time out the ARP entries.

  zh: 我曾在几次场合中看到第 8 条被提及与渗透测试和社会工程有关，但我必须说，确定其相关性相当困难。例如，在私人组织中，雇主实际上有权通过各种方式监控员工的活动，只要在员工合同或员工手册中说明即可。这可以包括闭路电视监控、阅读员工的电子邮件，甚至包裹检查。员工几乎在所有情况下都必须被告知正在发生这种情况，雇主必须有适当的理由进行监控。就社会工程参与的渗透测试部分而言，存在有限的风险区域。这些区域几乎总是涉及个人通信的意外拦截。例如，如果你进行
    ARP 毒化攻击的话，就可能发生这种情况。在我看来，这是一个很大的伸展，我之所以这样说是因为我绝对不会在需要进入设施然后插上并“入侵”的物理参与中进行 ARP
    毒化或 MITM。最好的方法始终是尽量避免在物理渗透测试中进行 ARP 毒化。这可能会带来极大的干扰。社会工程参与可能需要迅速行动，从连接的任何网络点中断开，而不是优雅地结束正在进行的工作。在
    ARP 毒化或其他 MITM 攻击的情况下，这将意味着客户的停机时间将持续多长时间，取决于交换机配置了多长时间超时 ARP 条目。
- en: An alternative to ARP poisoning would be to perform the Karma wireless attack.
    The Karma attack is where an attacker/penetration tester listens for a client,
    which is probing for known wireless networks. The attacker responds to the client
    claiming to be that access point, at which point the client connects. The typical
    scenario here is to sit in the middle of this session, capturing passwords and
    other data, and forwarding any traffic out onto the Internet. This gives a seamless
    experience to the client who never even suspects that the attack has happened.

  zh: ARP欺骗的替代方法是执行Karma无线攻击。 Karma攻击是指攻击者/渗透测试人员监听正在寻找已知无线网络的客户端。攻击者回应客户端，声称自己是该接入点，此时客户端连接。典型情况是坐在这个会话的中间，捕获密码和其他数据，并将任何流量转发到互联网上。这给客户端提供了无缝的体验，客户端甚至没有怀疑发生了攻击。
- en: This kind of attack is especially effective where an open wireless network is
    deployed by the organization for guest access. There is likely to be nothing stopping
    corporate laptops and devices from connecting to open networks, meaning it could
    provide some especially useful information during a social engineering engagement.
    Coming back onto the topic of the Human Rights Act, the engineer will likely be
    capturing other users data throughout this entire attack, some of whom may not
    even be employed by the client.

    bespoke offerings as a social engineer. However, it can be a good idea to offer
    both. Not only will it help the supporting sales force, but it can also work as
    a menu, for clients, enabling them to pick or choose what they feel would benefit
    them as a business. That is not to say that customers shouldn’t be steered toward
    what would be more beneficial to them, after all, the social engineer is well
    experienced in this field. There will be more on this topic in [Chapter 6](CHP006.xhtml),
    which deals with effective threat modeling. In any case, this section would document
    what is required, including any special or custom requirements. This may include
    specific departments or resources to target. A good example often used is to attempt
    to “borrow” a corporate laptop and leave the building. This kind of task should
    definitely result in the engineer scrambling around for that get out of jail free

    results of the assessment, along with a run through any evidence or collateral
    you have gathered. There have been several instances where during a social engineering
    engagement the engineers have gained physical access to a client site, and just
    turned up at their office for the debrief, or called them from one of their board
    room phones. While this kind of thing certainly adds impact to proceedings, there
    certainly is a need to know the audience before trying it. The last thing needed
    is to cause offense or appear to be showboating.

    throughout the assessment. Photographs and videos are always interesting to the
    client and can really emphasize the points being made. A detailed timeline of
    events is also crucial to the debrief. It is worth pointing out that gathering
    this evidence while performing the assessment can be very difficult, but certain
    types of technology, such as hidden cameras and microphones, can make it far easier.

    debriefed is understood. It is not uncommon for people to be shocked or even angry
    that they were breached and immediately start blame storming. The information
    has to be delivered with tact throughout the process. Avoid naming names or pointing
    fingers at individuals. Embarrassing or belittling people, even unintentionally,
    is not helpful to the process and is likely to cause resistance and resentment
    toward you and your findings. This is why splitting the deliverables between a
    debrief and a report works so well. The debrief allows the client to come to terms
    with what has happened, while explaining that the issues identified were procedural
    and not a fault of an individual, which is almost always true. By the time the
    written report arrives, likely a week later, things have settled down a little
    and the report can be looked upon in a more constructive manner.

    almost always are not.

    time should be dedicated toward addressing remediation. In the vast majority of

    find its way into the next round of staff awareness training to ensure that significant
    improvements are made. The security as a lifecycle mentality works well here with
    constant re-education and re-testing contributing toward a far healthier posture.

    corporate information from publicly available document metadata. Metadata is included
    when a document is created, but is often hidden from the end user during the process.
    In this instance, the data recovered included usernames, email addresses and locally
    installed software packages. In the wrong hands, this kind of information can
    be exceptionally damaging. As an example, the email addresses gathered can be
    used in targeted attacks known as Phishing. Phishing, in its most basic form,
    is the process of targeting individuals within an organisation in the hope that
    they will click a malicious link within an Email, or open a malicious attachment.
    In this event, the user’s computer could be completely compromised, which could
    lead to the loss of sensitive corporate data. The system could then become a platform
    for further attacks against other systems within the network. The locally installed
    software packages information can also be used by allowing an attacker to target
    software packages that are known to be vulnerable.

    for the cleaning of metadata, but this could go down to that level, if appropriate,
    as there are plenty of tools available. It also avoided getting too technical
    or using too much technical jargon at this stage. Further detail on each successful
    attack will be available further into the report. If a phishing attack was successful,
    reference the metadata issue as a starting point of the attack. Then include some
    screenshots of the email that was crafted, along with shots of the amount of clicks
    that it generated within the user base, the impact of that section of the report
    would be greatly increased. Having visual aids within a report makes a big difference
    for most readers, it really highlights the proof of concept and breaks up the
    wall of text that the report could otherwise become.

    this role and make calls as a part of our engagements.

  zh: 团队中的社会工程师是一位擅长操纵、说服和欺骗的人。有些人很幸运，这些技能自然而然地就掌握在他们手中。其他人则是在其他角色的职业生涯中逐渐学会了这些技能。例如，销售人员已经在不自觉地应用社会工程学的行业技巧！听一个销售人员试图让前台或呼叫中心接通他们的电话到首席技术官或类似职位的过程可能是一次开眼界的经历。通常销售团队会被要求扮演这个角色，并在我们的合作中拨打电话。
- en: As well as the supporting sales staff, there might be at least one dedicated
    social engineer on the team. It is most likely that he would spend the vast majority
    of his time on the phone trying to manipulate individuals into gaining entry for
    the generalists. Even though this is the case, never underestimate the power of
    face-to-face social engineering. People get calls they don’t want to deal with,
    or that seem suspicious all the time, but exposure to this in person is far rarer
    and as such can be more likely to work.

  zh: 除了支持销售人员外，团队中可能至少有一名专门的社会工程师。他很可能会花大部分时间打电话，试图操纵个人为通才们开门。尽管如此，永远不要低估面对面社会工程的力量。人们经常接到他们不想处理或看起来可疑的电话，但亲自接触这种情况要少得多，因此更有可能成功。

- en: The scout is responsible for all aspects of reconnaissance in the buildup and
    during the course of the engagement. This can range from gathering photographic
    evidence of the building and its security setup to establishing patrol times for
    guards. The scout will scope out entry and exit points, try to establish what
    door control mechanism is in use, and see if there is a particular time of day
    that may be more suited to the engagement. For example, if the plan is to tailgate
    the perimeter doors, the best time to do this is when the most people turn up
    to work. The more footfall there is through that door, the more opportunities
    there are to follow without looking too suspicious. There is nothing worse than
    standing around looking out of place waiting for someone to follow.

    of the office too. It is surprising how much useful information can be turned
    up on [images.google.com](http://www.images.google.com) and [maps.google.com](http://www.maps.google.com).
    In fact, it is common to find high-resolution pictures with ID badges in them
    using this technique. Google Maps can be used to scope out the physical location
    with a degree of accuracy, but should not be relied on exclusively. Street view
    is a particularly useful tool, which can help to identify entrances and exits,
    smoking areas, and security gates.

    This included a brief look at threat modeling, difficulties in time management,
    project management as well as ethical considerations. These topics were approached
    from the client’s perspective to try and help them identify the right people to
