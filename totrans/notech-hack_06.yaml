- en: Locks are serious business and lock technicians are true engineers, most backed
    with years of hands-on experience. But what happens when you take the age-old
    respected profession of the locksmith and sprinkle it with hacker ingenuity? That’s
    when the magic shows up again. The locks you and I once depended on fall victim
    to no-tech tools like fountain pens, electric flossers and toilet paper rolls;
    the combo locks that protected our stuff with tens of thousands of combinations
    fall in less than three minutes with no tools at all; the locks the government
    mandates we use on our luggage surrender to tools made of soda cans shims and
    discarded shards of plastic; and most disturbing of all we find that the gun locks
    that protect our children from harm snap open after clever wielding of a drinking
    straw. Once our locks fall to these trivial attacks, we count on our cameras,
    motion sensors and alarm systems, only to see them trivially bypassed as well.
    Sound serious? It is. We’ll be joined by some of the world’s foremost experts
    in the field, and we’ll have some fun along the way but I’m sure you’ll sense
    the sky over the security landscape darken as you make your way through the longest
    and most in-depth chapter yet. Welcome to the world of physical security, no-tech
    hacking style.

    disabling electronic surveillance systems. I imagined myself as that marine in
    the movie Aliens, Hudson (played by Bill Paxton), frantically noodling with wires
    in an electronic lock, trying to get his team inside to safety. Although I ended
    up breaking into all sorts of amazing places in real life—and eventually did bypass
    a number of electronic surveillance systems—I never had to resort to picking a
    single lock. Simpler techniques always prevailed. In this section, I’ll share
    some of the no-tech techniques that both beginner criminals and the most seasoned
    pros rely on.

    and internals, and perfecting the technique takes quite a bit of practice. *Lock
    bumping,* on the other hand, falls firmly into the no-tech hacking category. The
    technique involves the use of *bump keys,* which are keys fashoned by cutting
    a key blank so that each cut is made to a maximum depth and the tip and shoulder
    have been filed down by approximately half a millimeter. To a trained eye, bump
    keys have a very distinct look. The cuts are too uniform, as shown in the photo
    below.

- en: The technique works by inserting a bump key into a lock and tapping the key
    while turning it slightly in the lock. The bottom internal pins in the lock are
    nudged, transferring momentum to the pins sitting above them. As the top pins
    fly upwards, the bottom pins remain down. When the pins separate, the cylinder
    can be turned, and if done correctly, the lock will open. Bypassing a lock with
    a bump key takes much less skill than picking the lock with a traditional lock
    pick set or electronic pick device. This means that just about anyone can compromise
    a vulnerable lock when armed with a proper bump key. For more information on prevention
    and identification of vulnerable locks, see the references mentioned in the sidebar,
    or contact a professional locksmith or security provider.

  zh: 这种技术是通过将撞钥匙插入锁中，轻轻转动并轻击钥匙来实现的。锁内底部的内部销被推动，将动量传递给位于其上方的销。当顶部销向上飞起时，底部销保持在下方。当销分开时，插芯可以转动，如果操作正确，锁将打开。用撞钥匙绕过锁比用传统的锁挑选集或电子挑选设备挑选锁需要更少的技巧。这意味着只要有合适的撞钥匙，几乎任何人都可以破解一个易受攻击的锁。有关预防和识别易受攻击的锁的更多信息，请参阅侧边栏中提到的参考资料，或联系专业的锁匠或安全提供商。

- en: '*Shimming* is the use of a thin tool to bypass or disable the latch mechanism
    within a lock. By working a sheet or blade of material (typically steel or aluminum)
    into the right areas within a lock, components responsible for retaining a shackle
    or bolt can be forced aside, allowing the mechanism to release. This is typically
    only possible when critical elements of the lock rely exclusively on spring pressure
    to click into place. In essence, shimming causes the lock to operate as if it
    were being *secured* by the user. If snapping a padlock shut requires that a small
    bar slips out of the way, shimming focuses on getting that bar out of the way.
    This is similar to the classic “credit card” attack, in which a credit card is
    used to slip back the latch of a locked door.'

    ways is to open the lock and prod the retaining bar (found inside the shackle
    chamber) with a small tool such as a pick or wrench tool. If the bar can be easily
    pushed out of the way, it is spring-loaded and can most likely be shimmed. If
    you’re feeling like you’ve been drug into an uncharted wilderness of lockpicking
    technology and left for dead, let me try to put this a bit more simply: you can
    poke at a locks sensitive bits with a skinny stick to see if it can be opened
    with the same skinny stick. That’s not too much of an over-generalization.'

    two notches, the lock has a single rudimentary retaining bar mechanism meant to
    accommodate the lock body no matter which way the body is affixed when the lock
    is secured.

- en: If a multi-notched lock contains two separate retaining bars, shimming might
    become more difficult. Because of the way padlocks are constructed, it’s not feasible
    to give the more hidden of these two bars the “poke test.” But testing one bar
    is sufficient; if one side of a lock’s retaining mechanism is spring-loaded, the
    other probably is as well. The problem with shimming a multi-notched lock is that
    you must use two shims, one for each notch. That can cause problems if the gaps
    along the shackle are tight. Store-bought shims made of spring steel tend to be
    too thick for this task, meaning that the attacker has to use something thinner,
    like a strip of aluminum from a soda or beer can. Think that’s still too-much
    technical mumbo-jumbo? Remember, we’re now talking about popping locks with *two*
    long skinny sticks. Generally.

    one entry technique an average person can pull off without training, given the
    right circumstances. Still, I seem to run into the right circumstances all the
    time because I get this working a little too often. The technical term for this
    technique is *loiding.* The way it works is simple. To get past a locked window,
    an attacker may try to slip a credit card (or a thin, strong bit of wire) between
    the window stiles in order to throw the latch into the unlocked position. To get
    past a door, the attacker will slip the card between the door strike and the latch
    bolt in an attempt to separate the bolt from the door strike, which will open
    the door (assuming there’s only one engaged lock on the door).

    engineer an employee in some way. Tailgating comes to mind as well, but either
    of these softer options might tip off an employee that something’s not quite right,
    even if the attack succeeds initially. The best option is to wait and watch. Inevitably,
    an employee will exit, and a no-tech hacker will get a glimpse of the exit procedure

    of the diagram, it was blind to his entrance through the door in the opposite
    corner. He made his way to the opposite wall and traversed along it, staying out
    of the sensor’s field for most of his approach. Reaching the edge of the field,
    he played it smart and turned directly into the IR beam. By doing this, he was
    able to maintain the ever-so-peppy pace of one foot every four to twelve seconds.
    According to Ross, “That part was pretty easy. The tough part was moving across
    to the door. Then I moved really slow, about two to four inches at a time with
    about a six second interval between each move. This is where I kept messing up.
    I didn’t realize how slow I needed to go, but I eventually got it."

    dressed in a neoprene suit in order to take on a motion sensor. His cohort (River
    Phoenix) prepared the room in advance by raising the room’s temperature to match
    Bishop’s body temperature. In painfully slow steps, Bishop reached his goal without
    tripping the alarm. According to the crew of the awesome show *MythBusters,* many
    elements of this scene ring true. In the second part of *Crimes and Myth-Demeanors*
    ([http://shopping.discovery.com/index.html](http://shopping.discovery.com/index.html)),
    the Mythbusters – Kari, Grant and Tory – took on several security devices including
    PIR and ultrasonic motion sensors. They found that the “slow and low” technique
    also works well against ultrasonic sensors, which use high-frequency sound instead
    of infrared light. They also discovered that a neoprene suit would hide an intruder’s
    heat signature from a PIR sensor for a short while. But eventually, the suit absorbs
    the intruder’s body heat, making him visible to the sensor again. They also tried
    raising the room’s temperature to 98°F in order to fool a PIR sensor, but this
    test failed—the sensor triggered immediately. They were able to bypass a PIR sensor
    by placing a piece of glass in front of the sensor, but this would only work if
    the temperature of the glass was close enough to the temperature of the room.
    In the most surprising test, Kari spread a bed sheet in front of herself while
    crossing an ultrasonic field and the alarm was not triggered.

    or civilian? Neat or messy? The list could go on and on.

    not only a shoulder surfing session and a roomful of potential information, but
    also one pilot’s lanyard and string of badges. So many options in one photo.

    of awareness, or the TSA’s obliviousness to the whole affair. Rather, the point
    is that even in an environment where security is a top priority, no-tech hackers
    can have an absolute field day. If it’s possible to gather all this information
    in mere moments at an airport, it’s possible anywhere.
