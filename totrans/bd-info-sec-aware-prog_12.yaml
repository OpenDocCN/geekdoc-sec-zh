- en: We'll begin with types of formal training. Formal training is a controlled and
    structured approach, which typically involves material based on written regulations
    or standards, policies, or a set of requirements [[1](#bb0010)]. The content development
    process is usually labor-intensive, as most programs require development of courseware.
    Evaluations, such as quizzes, are usually completed after content delivery to
    assess the employee's understanding and retention of the presented material.

  zh: 我们将从正式培训类型开始。正式培训是一种受控和结构化的方法，通常涉及基于书面法规或标准、政策或一组要求的材料[[1](#bb0010)]。内容开发过程通常是劳动密集型的，因为大多数项目需要开发课件。评估，如测验，通常在内容传递后完成，以评估员工对所呈现材料的理解和保留情况。

    approach in training techniques. Typically, this includes the use of slideshows
    that are custom-built for the target audience. However, it does not need to be
    limited to slideshows alone. Other delivery methods can be used to convey material
    including the following:'

    a threat, such as tailgating.'

    It enables the instructor to provide examples of situations where employees followed
    procedure or sought guidance from their security division. Storytelling also enables
    the instructor to provide an example of material covered previously in the course
    to reaffirm the message [[2](#bb0015)].'

  zh: ■ 讲故事：讲故事是在讲座中加入个人风格的好方法。它使讲师能够提供员工遵循程序或向安全部门寻求指导的情况示例。讲故事还使讲师能够提供先前课程中涵盖的材料示例，以重申信息[[2](#bb0015)]。
- en: While the main delivery method of the session is lecture from the instructor,
    other methods can be used to incorporate audience interaction. The discussion
    method usually begins with a short lecture including basic information and is
    followed by open discussion or questions (from the instructor or the audience)
    to provide clarification on the material. Asking the audience to identify indicators
    of a phishing e-mail is an example of the discussion method [[3](#bb0020)].

    web server or by an external training provider. Because the content is stored
    in a small number of locations, it is easy to update. Courses can be integrated
    into a training portal that enables the organization to offer multiple courses
    and electronically track each employee's progress. This delivery vehicle makes
    it easy to create targeted training for different audiences such as the help desk
    or marketing. WBT is a great method for delivering material small, focused sessions,
    such as phishing awareness. Many of the advantages are similar to CBT in addition
    to others.

    few words and deliver a clear message. Prime examples of security awareness posters
    come from the “loose lips sink ships” campaign during World War II. Designed by
