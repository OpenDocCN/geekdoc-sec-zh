    we'll discuss various training techniques and their pros and cons. This chapter
    presents a high-level overview of training techniques. In chapters to come, we'll
    discuss how to package or blend these techniques to suit your environment.

- en: We'll begin with types of formal training. Formal training is a controlled and
    structured approach, which typically involves material based on written regulations
    or standards, policies, or a set of requirements [[1](#bb0010)]. The content development
    process is usually labor-intensive, as most programs require development of courseware.
    Evaluations, such as quizzes, are usually completed after content delivery to
    assess the employee's understanding and retention of the presented material.

- en: 'In-person training, or instructor-led training, is considered a traditional
    approach in training techniques. Typically, this includes the use of slideshows
    that are custom-built for the target audience. However, it does not need to be
    limited to slideshows alone. Other delivery methods can be used to convey material
    including the following:'

    providing the audience with a visual focus point. This method is best for demonstrating
    a threat, such as tailgating.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '■ Storytelling: Storytelling is a great way to put a personal spin on a lecture.
    It enables the instructor to provide examples of situations where employees followed
    procedure or sought guidance from their security division. Storytelling also enables
    the instructor to provide an example of material covered previously in the course
    to reaffirm the message [[2](#bb0015)].'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While the main delivery method of the session is lecture from the instructor,
    other methods can be used to incorporate audience interaction. The discussion
    method usually begins with a short lecture including basic information and is
    followed by open discussion or questions (from the instructor or the audience)
    to provide clarification on the material. Asking the audience to identify indicators
    of a phishing e-mail is an example of the discussion method [[3](#bb0020)].

- en: The use of computer-based training (CBT) has grown rapidly over the years, in
    some cases replacing in-person training altogether. CBT is delivered through a
    computer and can utilize a magnitude of delivery options such as text, audio,
    video, interactive quizzes, and many more. However, CBT material is stored locally
    on a hard drive or distributed via CD-ROM. Material is often created solely for
    the organization to fit their requirements at a certain point in time [[3](#bb0020)].

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Web-based training (WBT) is similar to CBT but is housed online via a company
    web server or by an external training provider. Because the content is stored
    in a small number of locations, it is easy to update. Courses can be integrated
    into a training portal that enables the organization to offer multiple courses
    and electronically track each employee's progress. This delivery vehicle makes
    it easy to create targeted training for different audiences such as the help desk
    or marketing. WBT is a great method for delivering material small, focused sessions,
    such as phishing awareness. Many of the advantages are similar to CBT in addition
    to others.

  prefs: []

    training. However, if the employee answers a question incorrectly, it is crucial
    to provide a follow-up page to explain why the answer was incorrect.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: WBT has the flexibility to feature video segments from industry professionals
    in addition to slideshow material. The combination of delivery methods divides
    the material into segments, making it easier to comprehend. Employees can also
    replay video segments if they were not able to keep up with the pace of the speaker.
  prefs: []

    presented material with the option of follow-on training based on the employee's

    no interaction from the employee. These segments cover one or two topics in a
    short amount of time, such as the use of removable media. Video training is most
    effective when incorporated into a video campaign. A video campaign consists of
    a set of videos and other supporting materials such as posters, preview videos,
    announcement e-mails, and a reference sheet to accompany each video.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Informal training is designed with an overall objective, but without the standards
    and procedures of formal training. While formal learning is usually required of
    employees, informal learning is voluntary. Essentially, informal learning provides
    the means for education, but the employee must decide to pursue the material.
    While informal learning environments are ideal for some employees, they are not
    meant to replace formal training programs. Informal learning acts as an additional
    layer of support to a formal training program [[8](#bb0045)].

    presentations or discussions can cover a variety of topics. The key to successful

    team should rotate sessions so that employees are familiar with all team members.
    This helps to place a face to the security team and reinforces a two-way dialog.
    If the budget allows, inviting guest speakers is a great way to increase attendance.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    coordinating with department heads to create lunch and learn sessions that appeal
    to technical employees as well. Some example topics include

    dramatically changed the way that the world views video content. Short, homemade
    videos are the new norm in today's society. From dancing cats and giggling babies
    to software installation procedures and cooking instructions are available to
    anyone with just a few clicks of a mouse. Like most topics, security awareness
    training can also use this video craze to its advantage.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Producing short, informal videos for the organization's internal website can
    reinforce material that has been previously covered in formal training. This virtually
    no-cost technique can also incorporate the workforce into the education process
    by featuring the Chief Information Security Office (CISO) forgetting sensitive
    documents at the printer. Other employees can be featured following procedure,
    such as challenging someone who is attempting to tailgate into the building.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Security awareness posters are a low-cost method to reinforce good security
    practice principles between formal sessions. The two most important factors of
    a successful poster campaign are content and placement. Content should have very
    few words and deliver a clear message. Prime examples of security awareness posters
    come from the “loose lips sink ships” campaign during World War II. Designed by
    the War Advertising Council, the campaign was a reminder to all Americans to be
    discrete with the information they shared to prevent unintentional data leaks
    to the enemy [[9](#bb0050)].
