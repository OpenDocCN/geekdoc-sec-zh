    set that can make or break a social engineer's ability to achieve success in his
    or her ploy.  Most productive social engineers have the adequate knowledge in
    use the tools, which closes in the break between failure and success.

    even the best or most expensive ones, will not guarantee success in their ploys. 
    The tools only allow social engineers to enhance their security practice, especially
    when they are executing their attacks.

    them secure without the involvement of computers.  It usually involves motion
    cameras, locks, and window sensors among others.  In social engineering, it is
    important to understand how physical security works just as it is valuable for
    ordinary people to understand simply security mechanisms.

    simply putting a lock pick in and the door opens instantly.  Some people have
    knowledge in lock picking; however, most people learn how to do it slowly with
    countless attempts, frustration, and tension.  A skill that is associated with
    lock picking is raking.  It is using a raking tools and sliding it in and out
    of the lock gently with minimal pressure to the tension wrench.  More often than
    not, lock picking coupled with raking works on most types of locks, making the
    breach as simple and effortless as possible.  Social engineers learn the skills
    of lock picking and raking efficiently to conduct their ploys.

    and other types of electronic badges, making lock picks almost obsolete.  For
    instance, in 2004, Wal-Mart has launched a pilot program by making use of radio
    frequency identification (RFID) technology in relation to its strategic plan of
    using inventory-tracking tags for its top suppliers.  RFID is known as a type
    of automatic identification system, which enables data to be transmitted through
    a portable device referred to as a tag.  The tag is read by an RFID reader and
    processed based on the needs of a particular application.  The data transmitted
    by the tag may furnish identification or location information about the tagged
    product including date of purchase, color, and price among others.  According
    to Wal-Mart, RFID will provide employees greater ability to locate products within
    a location and get them on shelves as customers need them.  On the other hand,
    the use of RFID can also cause implications to its people, say, on their auditors. 
    Certified public accountants and auditors will have to obtain the skills and knowledge
    to reassess accounting procedures, systems, and methods related to the use of
    RFID systems.  In fact, they will have to be skilled in assessing RFID system
    controls and note signs of inaccuracy or insufficiency of information such as
    partial inventory counts.  Security of information may also be affected by the
    use of RFID systems.  The illicit tracking of RFID tags has been a principal security
    concern of RFID technology.  Tags pose risks to both personal location privacy
    and business security since they are world-readable.  Thus, locks and lock picking
    are still used in many companies that do not have enough financial capability
    to install types of electronic access.

    plan that supports them.  For instance, a company may have installed a heavy-duty
    lock that demands for biometrics as well as key access in order to enter the server
    room; however, the next door may have a single-paned glass window in which scammers,
    thieves, or social engineers can easily break and gain access with minimal effort.

    if the locks belong to the top of the line types.  Social engineers know for a
    fact that security does not merely rely on a piece of hardware.

    for more security, people are tested on their knowledge and skills about company
    security.  However, the same principles are employed when social engineers carry
    out their ploys.

    or tricked by social engineers.  In fact, most people would deny being fooled
    by a simple social engineering tactic due to fear of job repercussions as well
    as embarrassment.  Recording devices can show proof that the trickery actually
    happened although they can also be used to train both employers and employees,
    specifically on what signals to watch out for.

    or trouble.  On the other hand, the information obtained from these devices provides
    valuable learning to show employees who fell for the pretexts and other scams
    of social engineers.

    social engineer's successful hack.  This can educate both employers and employees
    on how they should deal with malicious attempts involved in social engineering.

    engineering ploys, especially from advanced or highly-skilled social engineers. 
    In camera recordings, for instance, the staff can see the facial gestures and
    other little details of social engineers.  Thus, once the camera captures those
    details, the staff has something to analyze so as to be ready for a social engineering
    attack.

    their ploys.  With the advent of cell phones, homemade phone servers, and VoIP,
    social engineers are given a wide range of options to conduct their malicious
    schemes via the telephone.

    advertisements, social engineers are compelled to be skillful when it comes to
    using the phone, leading to a successful ploy.  As simple as it may seem, social
    engineers who use the phone as a tool can compromise a company's security in a
    matter of minutes.

    personal and business conversations on subways, buses, and any other public places. 
    In these places, social engineers are likely to eavesdrop or call their targets
    on their cell phones to obtain additional vectors, which may not be available
    during their previous malicious attempts.

    in numbers, most people are inclined to storing personal data, passwords, and
    other private information in these devices.  As such, social engineers are provided
    with yet another opportunity to carry out their ploys because they can have access
    to their targets as well as their data in various situations.
  prefs: []

- en: In addition, people have 24/7 access to their smart phones, which makes them
    more inclined to giving out information quickly when social engineers pose as
    “believable” callers.  Take for example the caller Ids on cell phones, which indicates
    the identity of the person calling.  When social engineers successfully access
    their targets through calling them from a corporate building, the targets are
    likely to give out information willingly without verifying the caller's identity. 
    Certain applications in Android and iPhone smart phones are available for spoofing
    caller ID numbers to any number desired.

    engineers make it a point to spend time in gathering information about their objectives
    and targets to ensure success in their ploys.  Today, there are various tools
    that can help social engineers in gathering, collecting, utilizing, and cataloging
    the data they have collected.  This means that social engineers are no longer
    limited to what they can obtain from routine searches as online and software-based
    tools are already available.

- en: While social engineers take most of their time in honing their skills, much
    of the variables for carrying out their ploys require the ability to generate
    PDFs and/or emails, which are embedded with malicious codes.  Social engineers
    have developed the social engineer toolkit (SET), which provides them the ability
    to penetrate their targets easier and quicker through malicious codes.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Nowadays, SET is continuously expanding.  In fact, recently, SET has proven
    its capability to handle attacks such as an infectious media generator in addition
    to spear phishing and website cloning.  An infectious media generator allows a
    user to create a CD, DVD, or USB key, which is encoded with a malicious file. 
    Then, the CD, DVD, or USB key is left or dropped at the office building of the
    target.  Once it is inserted and ran in a computer, the generator will carry out
    its malicious payload, causing the computer of the target to be compromised.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: SET also has the capability to produce a simple payload as well as a proper
    listener.  For instance, if a social engineer wants to embed an EXE with a reversed
    shell connecting back to their servers, a USB key may be used to carry the payload
    and carry out their ploy.  Once the social engineer finds a computer or any machine
    for remote access, they can insert the USB key and ran the payload file.  This
    allows the social engineer a quick connection back to their servers.

    moment they are plugged in.  It also commands tiny boards to give reversed shells
    or set up listening ports.

- en: As mentioned, SET also has a web interface feature in which a web server starts
    to host the SET automatically on a web page so the social engineer can use it
    easily.  Thus, SET is an extremely powerful social engineering tool that allows
    attackers to test the weaknesses of targets, specifically in companies.

    information about their targets, social engineers create a profile of each of
    their target.  This profile is used to plan out some attack strategies that social
    engineers deem fit for a specific target.  A profile is also used to establish
    a list of potential passwords that social engineers can use in their ploys.  Passwords
    can help social engineers in carrying out a hack, specifically when the situation
    presents such option.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are several password profilers that are used in social engineering, which
    provide assistance in profiling potential passwords of a target or company.  Some
    of these password profiling tools include Who's Your Daddy (WYD) and Common User
    Passwords Profiler (CUPP).

    every year in spite of various warnings issued by both private and government
    sectors.  In addition, the number of individuals listing all types of information
    about themselves, their lives, and their families on the Internet is also rising.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Social engineers can profile and outline the entire life of their targets by
    simply using their tools and combining a profile established from social media
    usage.  This works well on the part of social engineers given that most people
    choose their passwords.  Fact is, most people use the same password for various
    Internet accounts such as emails and social networks.  Worse, these people choose
    passwords that others can guess easily.

- en: While social engineering tools are important to carry out malicious tactics,
    they do not guarantee the success of a social engineer.  Tools are useless unless
    they are coupled with knowledge on their usage.  Social engineers should also
    be able to maximize these tools in order to result in a successful ploy.  As such,
    potential targets should also have knowledge about these tools as they are commonly
    used even by ordinary people.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Regardless of what tool social engineers use, whether it is a physical tool,
    phone tool, software tool, or a combination of tools, successful ploys are only
    possible if they have adequate knowledge of each tool.  On the part of targets,
    they should be doubly aware of the features of these tools so as not to become
    victims of social engineering.
