  zh: 第三章：社会工程学工具
- en: Apart from psychological principles, social engineering also uses a decent tool
    set that can make or break a social engineer's ability to achieve success in his
    or her ploy.  Most productive social engineers have the adequate knowledge in
    use the tools, which closes in the break between failure and success.

  zh: 除了心理学原理之外，社会工程还使用一个不错的工具集，可以决定一个社会工程师是否能够成功地执行他或她的策略。大多数高效的社会工程师都具有使用这些工具的充足知识，这弥补了失败与成功之间的差距。
- en: It is important to take note that social engineers who merely possess the tools,
    even the best or most expensive ones, will not guarantee success in their ploys. 
    The tools only allow social engineers to enhance their security practice, especially
    when they are executing their attacks.

  zh: 值得注意的是，社会工程师仅仅拥有工具，即使是最好或最昂贵的工具，也不能保证在他们的策略中取得成功。这些工具只是让社会工程师增强他们的安全实践，特别是在执行攻击时。
- en: Social engineering has three categories of tools, including physical tools,
    phone tools, and software-based tools.

  zh: 物理工具
- en: Physical security refers to measures, which people or companies utilize to keep
    them secure without the involvement of computers.  It usually involves motion
    cameras, locks, and window sensors among others.  In social engineering, it is
    important to understand how physical security works just as it is valuable for
    ordinary people to understand simply security mechanisms.

  zh: 物理安全指的是人们或公司在没有涉及计算机的情况下采取的措施，用于保障安全。通常涉及运动摄像头、锁和窗户传感器等设备。在社会工程中，了解物理安全的工作原理同样重要，就像普通人了解简单的安全机制一样有价值。
- en: For instance, lock picking, as portrayed on television and in the movies is
    simply putting a lock pick in and the door opens instantly.  Some people have
    knowledge in lock picking; however, most people learn how to do it slowly with
    countless attempts, frustration, and tension.  A skill that is associated with
    lock picking is raking.  It is using a raking tools and sliding it in and out
    of the lock gently with minimal pressure to the tension wrench.  More often than
    not, lock picking coupled with raking works on most types of locks, making the
    breach as simple and effortless as possible.  Social engineers learn the skills
    of lock picking and raking efficiently to conduct their ploys.

  zh: 例如，电视和电影中所描述的撬锁技术，似乎只需把撬锁工具插入，门就会立即打开。一些人了解撬锁技术；然而，大多数人都是通过无数次尝试、挫折和紧张来慢慢学会的。与撬锁技术相关的一个技巧是撬动。这是使用撬动工具，轻轻地在锁孔中移动，用最小的压力作用于张力扳手。通常情况下，撬锁技术结合撬动技巧可以打开大多数类型的锁，使入侵尽可能简单和轻松。社会工程师高效地学习撬锁技术和撬动技巧以执行他们的策略。
- en: Today, a number of companies and organizations are using RFID, magnetic cards,
    and other types of electronic badges, making lock picks almost obsolete.  For
    instance, in 2004, Wal-Mart has launched a pilot program by making use of radio
    frequency identification (RFID) technology in relation to its strategic plan of
    using inventory-tracking tags for its top suppliers.  RFID is known as a type
    of automatic identification system, which enables data to be transmitted through
    a portable device referred to as a tag.  The tag is read by an RFID reader and
    processed based on the needs of a particular application.  The data transmitted
    by the tag may furnish identification or location information about the tagged
    product including date of purchase, color, and price among others.  According
    to Wal-Mart, RFID will provide employees greater ability to locate products within
    a location and get them on shelves as customers need them.  On the other hand,
    the use of RFID can also cause implications to its people, say, on their auditors. 
    Certified public accountants and auditors will have to obtain the skills and knowledge
    to reassess accounting procedures, systems, and methods related to the use of
    RFID systems.  In fact, they will have to be skilled in assessing RFID system
    controls and note signs of inaccuracy or insufficiency of information such as
    partial inventory counts.  Security of information may also be affected by the
    use of RFID systems.  The illicit tracking of RFID tags has been a principal security
    concern of RFID technology.  Tags pose risks to both personal location privacy
    and business security since they are world-readable.  Thus, locks and lock picking
    are still used in many companies that do not have enough financial capability
    to install types of electronic access.

  zh: 如今，许多公司和组织正在使用射频识别（RFID）、磁卡和其他类型的电子徽章，使得撬锁几乎过时了。例如，2004年，沃尔玛启动了一个试点项目，利用无线射频识别（RFID）技术来实施其战略计划，为其主要供应商使用库存跟踪标签。RFID被称为一种自动识别系统，它使数据能够通过一种被称为标签的便携式设备进行传输。标签被RFID读卡器读取，并根据特定应用的需求进行处理。标签传输的数据可能包括已标记产品的识别或位置信息，例如购买日期、颜色和价格等。据沃尔玛称，RFID将使员工更有能力在需要时在某个位置找到产品并将其放在货架上供顾客选购。另一方面，RFID的使用也会对其员工产生影响，比如对他们的审计师。注册会计师和审计师将不得不获得重新评估与RFID系统使用相关的会计程序、系统和方法的技能和知识。实际上，他们将需要熟练评估RFID系统控制，并注意到不准确或信息不足的迹象，例如部分库存清点。RFID系统的使用也可能影响信息的安全性。RFID标签的非法跟踪一直是RFID技术的主要安全问题。由于标签是可读的，因此它们对个人位置隐私和企业安全构成风险。因此，对于许多没有足够财力安装电子门禁系统的公司来说，锁和撬锁仍然被广泛使用。
- en: The problem in using locks is not due to the choice of locks, but the security
    plan that supports them.  For instance, a company may have installed a heavy-duty
    lock that demands for biometrics as well as key access in order to enter the server
    room; however, the next door may have a single-paned glass window in which scammers,
    thieves, or social engineers can easily break and gain access with minimal effort.

  zh: 使用锁的问题并不在于锁的选择，而在于支持它们的安全计划。例如，一家公司可能已经安装了一个需要生物识别和钥匙访问才能进入服务器房间的重型锁；然而，隔壁可能有一个单层玻璃窗，骗子、小偷或社会工程师可以轻易地打破并以极少的努力就能进入。
- en: Thus, locks alone are not enough security for companies and even homes regardless
    if the locks belong to the top of the line types.  Social engineers know for a
    fact that security does not merely rely on a piece of hardware.

  zh: 因此，仅靠锁并不足以确保公司甚至家庭的安全，无论这些锁是否属于顶级类型。社会工程师确切地知道安全不仅仅依赖于一件硬件。
- en: During a social engineering audit wherein a company patches its human infrastructure
    for more security, people are tested on their knowledge and skills about company
    security.  However, the same principles are employed when social engineers carry
    out their ploys.

  zh: 在社会工程审计过程中，公司对其人力基础进行加固以提升安全性，人们将接受关于公司安全的知识和技能测试。然而，当社会工程师实施他们的策略时，同样的原则也会被应用。
- en: In general, people are unwilling to admit that they are inclined to being fooled
    or tricked by social engineers.  In fact, most people would deny being fooled
    by a simple social engineering tactic due to fear of job repercussions as well

    happened although they can also be used to train both employers and employees,

- en: Cameras and recording devices should never be used in getting employees to embarrassment
    or trouble.  On the other hand, the information obtained from these devices provides

    engineering ploys, especially from advanced or highly-skilled social engineers. 
    In camera recordings, for instance, the staff can see the facial gestures and

- en: Today, most people, if not all, are using cell phones and carry them both for
    personal and business conversations on subways, buses, and any other public places. 
    In these places, social engineers are likely to eavesdrop or call their targets

- en: As smart phones and hand-held phones that resemble computers are increasing
    in numbers, most people are inclined to storing personal data, passwords, and
    other private information in these devices.  As such, social engineers are provided

  zh: 随着智能手机和类似计算机的手持电话数量的增加，大多数人倾向于在这些设备中存储个人数据、密码和其他私人信息。因此，社会工程师又获得了一个机会来进行他们的诡计，因为他们可以在各种情况下访问他们的目标以及他们的数据。
- en: In addition, people have 24/7 access to their smart phones, which makes them
    more inclined to giving out information quickly when social engineers pose as
    “believable” callers.  Take for example the caller Ids on cell phones, which indicates
    the identity of the person calling.  When social engineers successfully access
    their targets through calling them from a corporate building, the targets are
    likely to give out information willingly without verifying the caller's identity. 
    Certain applications in Android and iPhone smart phones are available for spoofing
    caller ID numbers to any number desired.

- en: Nowadays, SET is continuously expanding.  In fact, recently, SET has proven
    its capability to handle attacks such as an infectious media generator in addition

    Then, the CD, DVD, or USB key is left or dropped at the office building of the

- en: SET also has the capability to produce a simple payload as well as a proper
