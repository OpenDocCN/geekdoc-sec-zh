- en: When it comes to preventing social engineering attacks, the main defenses are
    preventing spam, requiring permissions for code to run a system, and a collection
    of tips sheets offered up by various organizations and government agencies. Hopefully
    these efforts have been helpful in reducing the number and the effectiveness of
    social engineering attacks, but the attacks continue and people continue to be
    victimized at the cost of billions of dollars every year. Thus, the efforts to
    educate the public on prevention need to be greatly expanded and, above all, should
    include accurate information to fight against disinformation, misinformation,
    and fake news, and do this with unbiased and accurate information. This will require
    the use of all communication tools in order to inform people about inaccurate
    or malicious material being circulated through all media. This chapter examines
    many of the challenges that defenders face when trying to prevent damage from
    social engineering attacks whether they originate in St. Petersburg or Washington,
    DC.

    consumers clearly shows that greater effort is needed to make this information
    more useful and to get it more widely distributed. In addition to usefulness and
    distribution shortcomings, most tips and advice on social engineering is rather
    flat and shallow. There is more than one type of social engineering attack that
    needs to be defended against and a one-size-fits-all approach to education and
    awareness building is not adequate. [Figure 8.1](chapter8.xhtml#fig8.1) shows
    four types of social engineering attacks that people can fall victim to, only
    to end up with a myriad of problems in their lives.

    can serve as a planning and guidance tool for educators. The quick hit attack
    through email or links to malicious websites is certainly the easiest attack to
    explain and to defend against, the issue that remains is why so many people still
    become victims of such attacks.

    is more sophisticated. The promise of an inside scoop on a conspiracy, or malicious
    text about or photos of celebrities or politicians, keeps users engaged and moves
    them toward more specific actions. This includes continuing to follow the posts
    or emails to find out or see more, especially when it comes to emotional topics
    like Islamophobia, xenophobia, racism, sexism, or hatred of liberals. These attacks
    are designed to keep people engaged as long as possible and when possible recruit
    them into a symbolic clan or tribe of like thinkers. This type of attack is more
    complex to explain because people are responding to their beliefs and are drawn
    in by what they want to hear or see as opposed to a more balanced perspective.

    were made famous by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, Islamic State of Iraq
    and the Levant, the Islamic State, or Daesh (ISIS) over the last several years
    as the organization worked to recruit people into the cause as supporters or fighters,

    campaign ineffective is the diversity in the population. The persuasion and divisiveness
    attack was used heavily during the 2014 to 2020 elections in several countries.
    These attacks were very effective among some segments of the population and less
    effective with other segments. In the United States, voting and registration rates

    for citizens with at least a bachelor’s degree was 76.3% compared to 34.3% for
    those who had not received a high school diploma. [Table 8.1](chapter8.xhtml#T8.1)

    to justify the use of disinformation, along with their misleading statements and
    their blatant lies and false claims about their talents and motivations and the
    weaknesses of their opponents. The conservatives confess they are fighting a culture
    war for power and do not care if they lie, cheat, steal, or desecrate American

    URL to manage their class, along with further instructions. The link never expires,
    so they do not need to register for ­FBI-SOS every year. Once they are registered,
    they can create classes and an access test key for each student. The FBI does
    not store any information on students, so it is the responsibility of the teacher
    to create the test keys and keep track of which test key they assigned to each
    student. Students will then navigate through the various games and activities
    in their grade-appropriate island. When students complete the last activity, they
    can click the Take the Test surfboard to take the exam.

    Immediately after the test is taken, a temporary web page shows each student his
    or her score and a list of any questions answered incorrectly. Teachers can ask
    students to print and save this web page, and/or they can request the exam results
    of each class through the class management system. The class results show the

    the transition of the Office for Community Partnerships (OCP) to the Office of
    Terrorism Prevention Partnerships (OTPP). The mission of the OTPP is to enhance
    education and community awareness regarding the threat, provide resources as appropriate
    to terrorism prevention stakeholders, coordinate relevant DHS terrorism prevention
    activities, actively counter terrorist radicalization and recruitment, and promote
    early warning so that frontline defenders can intervene to stop attacks and help
    prevent individuals from going down the path to violence. The OTPP is the primary
    source of leadership, innovation, and support for the improved effectiveness of
    partners at federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial levels. It also leverages
    the resources and relationships of the Department of Homeland Security and applies
