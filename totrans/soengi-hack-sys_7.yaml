    preventing spam, requiring permissions for code to run a system, and a collection
    of tips sheets offered up by various organizations and government agencies. Hopefully
    these efforts have been helpful in reducing the number and the effectiveness of
    social engineering attacks, but the attacks continue and people continue to be
    victimized at the cost of billions of dollars every year. Thus, the efforts to
    educate the public on prevention need to be greatly expanded and, above all, should
    include accurate information to fight against disinformation, misinformation,
    and fake news, and do this with unbiased and accurate information. This will require
    the use of all communication tools in order to inform people about inaccurate
    or malicious material being circulated through all media. This chapter examines
    many of the challenges that defenders face when trying to prevent damage from
    social engineering attacks whether they originate in St. Petersburg or Washington,
    DC.

    more useful and to get it more widely distributed. In addition to usefulness and
    distribution shortcomings, most tips and advice on social engineering is rather
    flat and shallow. There is more than one type of social engineering attack that
    needs to be defended against and a one-size-fits-all approach to education and
    awareness building is not adequate. [Figure 8.1](chapter8.xhtml#fig8.1) shows
    four types of social engineering attacks that people can fall victim to, only
    to end up with a myriad of problems in their lives.

    is more sophisticated. The promise of an inside scoop on a conspiracy, or malicious
    text about or photos of celebrities or politicians, keeps users engaged and moves
    them toward more specific actions. This includes continuing to follow the posts
    or emails to find out or see more, especially when it comes to emotional topics
    like Islamophobia, xenophobia, racism, sexism, or hatred of liberals. These attacks
    are designed to keep people engaged as long as possible and when possible recruit
    them into a symbolic clan or tribe of like thinkers. This type of attack is more
    complex to explain because people are responding to their beliefs and are drawn
    in by what they want to hear or see as opposed to a more balanced perspective.

    were made famous by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, Islamic State of Iraq
    and the Levant, the Islamic State, or Daesh (ISIS) over the last several years
    as the organization worked to recruit people into the cause as supporters or fighters,

    their blatant lies and false claims about their talents and motivations and the
