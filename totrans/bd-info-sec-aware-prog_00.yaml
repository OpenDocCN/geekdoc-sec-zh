    from firewalls to access-card systems, but they fail to invest in their most valuable
    resources in securing their environments—more specifically, their employees. All
    too often, security-awareness training is a once-a-year event involving dated
    and unengaging material that is largely ignored. The result is that employees
    lack understanding of modern-day attacks and their ramifications. This knowledge
    gap presents endless opportunities for attackers. In Building a Security Awareness
    Program, Bill Gardner and Valerie Thomas have detailed the steps for building
    an entire security-awareness program from scratch. The book also serves as a guidebook
    for those seeking to improve or modernize their existing security-awareness programs.

    a black-hat hacker and throughout my time as a security consultant. I have accessed
    thousands of systems by combining social engineering with technical attacks. During
    a recent penetration test, I obtained access to a client's network by e-mailing
    a malicious document that appeared to originate from one of the client's vendors.
    All it took was one click of a mouse and I was in. A few days later, I had access
    to the client's entire corporate network, source code, financials, and more.

    threats. The stories in the social engineering chapter may seem too good to be
    true, but they describe actual events. Thomas and Gardner have performed these
    attacks during penetration tests on unsuspecting employees and were successful
    every time. The best technologies in the world won't protect you if an attacker
    can walk right through the front door unchallenged. In [Chapter 12](B9780124199675000120.xhtml),
    “Bringing It All Together,” Thomas and Gardner define the steps needed not only
    to build an awareness program but also to begin the process of empowering the
    employee to challenge and verify suspicious behavior.

    the human element of security. Creating an awareness program from the ground up
    can be intimidating and overwhelming. Building a Security Awareness Program walks
    you through the step-by-step process of creating a program as unique as your organization
    so you'll be prepared when an attacker comes calling.

    an information security program and understanding what risks are really out there.
    For me, one of the largest risks we face in security today is through the human
    element. Bill and Valerie have done an amazing job in showing both the effectiveness
    of the types of attacks that can happen and most importantly how to build a successful
    program that aims at reducing the risks associated with targeted attacks. When
    I was a chief security officer for a Fortune 1000, building an education and awareness
    program was one of my most accomplishing moments. Not only did the awareness program
    give the security team an elevated detection capability with our employee population,
    but also it started to change the culture to something that was security-driven.
    When we implemented something in our organization, it wasn't because security
    was doing it to be draconian or overprotective—our employees actually understood
    that it was part of a much larger picture. A mission that mattered. Our program
    skyrocketed and moved at an escalated pace with executives and IT working for
    one goal alike. All because of our awareness program.

    better and we're locking down more things. Hackers move to the past of least resistance
    and that is our end-user population right now. We have to take action, we have
    to train our people, and most importantly, it has to matter to them. Education
    and awareness works, and I can prove it with folks that we work with all the time.
    I've seen awareness transform an entire company to be a security-driven one on
    a number of occasions. Focus less on the technology, and focus on the fundamental
    blocks of educating your users.

    build a successful security-awareness program, a way to pave your INFOSEC program
    forward, and a way to train users in a way that makes it possible to detect attacks.
    I'm such a big advocate on bringing awareness to corporations and employees; it's
    one of the most returns you will ever get on an investment. The blend that Bill
    and Valerie bring on showing successful attacks that have occurred in the wild
    and following it up with how to proactively defend is brilliant.

    and figure out how to implement everything that you've learned here. These words
    of advice come from experience and what works. Your program, your visibility,
    and your ability to stop attacks while reducing risk depends on it.
