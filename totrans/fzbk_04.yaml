    &nbsp;One way would be to check the number (and seriousness) of bugs found; but
    if bugs are scarce, we need a proxy for the likelihood of a test to uncover a
    bug. &nbsp;In this chapter, we introduce the concept of code coverage, measuring

- en: Sometimes we are not only interested in fuzzing as many as possible diverse
    program inputs, but in deriving specific test inputs that achieve some objective,
    such as reaching specific statements in a program. When we have an idea of what
    we are looking for, then we can search for it. Search algorithms are at the core
    of computer science, but applying classic search algorithms like breadth or depth
    first search to search for tests is unrealistic, because these algorithms potentially
    require us to look at all possible inputs. However, domain-knowledge can be used
    to overcome this problem. For example, if we can estimate which of several program
    inputs is closer to the one we are looking for, then this information can guide
    us to reach the target quicker – this information is known as a heuristic. The
    way heuristics are applied systematically is captured in meta-heuristic search
    algorithms. The &quot;meta&quot; denotes that these algorithms are generic and
    can be instantiated differently to different problems. Meta-heuristics often take
    inspiration from processes observed in nature. For example, there are algorithms
    mimicking evolutionary processes, swarm intelligence, or chemical reactions. In
    general, they are much more efficient than exhaustive search approaches such that
    they can be applied to vast search spaces – search spaces as vast as the domain
    of program inputs are no problem for them."><text text-anchor="middle" x="768.62"

    exercise all the possible behaviors that a system can have, especially when the
    input space is large. Quite often the execution of a specific branch of execution
    may happen only with very specific inputs, which could represent a minimal fraction
    of the input space. The traditional fuzzing methods relies on chance to produce
    inputs they need. However, relying on randomness to generate values that we want
    is a bad idea when the space to be explored is huge. For example, a function that
    accepts a string, even if one only considers the first $10$ characters, already
    has $2^{80}$ possible inputs. If one is looking for a specific string, random
    generation of values will take a few thousand years even in one of the super computers."><text

    of programs. &nbsp;In such contexts, one needs an infrastructure to collect failure

    processing, we must increase chances to obtain valid inputs. &nbsp;One such way
