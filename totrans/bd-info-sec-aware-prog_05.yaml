- en: Online attackers are motivated by a number of factors. Most are seeking to steal
    money or protected online information such as credit card numbers or intellectual
    property that can be used to make money. Other motivations are rooted in political
    protest in the case of hacktivism or rooted in furthering the interests of nation-states
    as the case of cyber war. The granddaddy of all motivations is bragging rights.
    Showing off your technical prowess and your advanced technical ability has long
    been held in high esteem in the digital underground.

    to understand the threats they face online, the threat actors, and the motivation
    of online criminals. Many times, users do not understand the value of the information
    they access every day to do their work. In the case of a law firm, the firm will
    have gathered a larger amount of confidential data to use representing the interests
    of their clients. In the case accounting firms, the firm has access to sensitive
    financial documents of their clients. Doctors, hospitals, and insurance companies
    have access to sensitive health data. Employers collect personal and financial
    information, such as social security numbers, and other personal information from
    their employees in order to process insurance and payroll. In the case of an employee
    with a family, the employer needs to collect the social security numbers and other
    personal information of family members.

    of dollars from online schemes, fraud, and thievery [[1](#bb0010)]. Some groups
    target computers to steal personal information and credit card information [[2](#bb0015)].
    Stolen credit card information can be either used directly or sold to other criminals.

    Hacktivism is defined as “the nonviolent use of illegal or legally ambiguous digital
    tools in pursuit of political ends. These tools include web site defacements,
    redirects, denial-of-service attacks, information theft…” [[6](#bb0035)].

    and most well known was Operation Sony. Also known as Op Sony, the operation Anonymous
    calls their cause de jour was the case of George Hotz who is also known as the
    first hacker to “jailbreak” the iPhone. George, known online by his handle GeoHot,
    also wanted to “jailbreak” his PlayStation 3, which would allow users the ability
    to play and share homemade games. On December 29th, 2010, George Hotz and the
    rest of hacker collective known as fail0verflow announced they had retrieved the
    root key of Sony's PlayStation 3 gaming console at the 29th Chaos Communications
    Congress. On January 3rd, 2011, George Hotz published his findings on his website,
    [geohot.com](http://geohot.com). On January 11th, 2011, Sony filed a lawsuit against
    George Hotz and other members of fail0verflow for releasing the PlayStation 3's
    root key [[7](#bb0040)].

    Sony, by taking the PlayStation Network (PSN) and several PlayStation-related
    domains, including the PlayStation Store, offline [[8](#bb0045)]. It was later
    learned that the attacks not only resulted in an outage of the PSN service but
    also turned out to be one of the largest data breaches in history involving over
    70 million records including personally identifiable information (PII) and credit
    card information [[9](#bb0050)].

    This brash subgroup of Anonymous ultimately took credit for stealing 24.6 million
    records in the PlayStation Network [[10](#bb0055)]. The group then went on an
    extensive hacking spree that involved a number of high-profile targets from [Fox.com](http://Fox.com)
    to PBS and the game company Bethesda Game Studios while tweaking the noses and
    taunting law enforcement the entire time. The group saw themselves as modern-day
    Robin Hoods that were exposing the insecurities of the websites they breached.
    As their hacking spree continued, they continued to garner public attention and
    the attention of law enforcement though the summer of 2011\. The group's activities
    became more brazen and outlandish [[10](#bb0055)]. By the beginning of the fall
    of 2011, the group began to unravel when it was reported that the group's leader
    Sabu, whose real name is Hector Xavier Monsegur, was arrested on June 7, 2011,
    and had turned FBI informant [[11](#bb0060)]. By the end of 2011, all the members
    of the LulzSec crew would be arrested and jailed. While the reign of the LulzSec
    crew had ended, the various groups known as Anonymous live on.

    where each user posted as an Anonymous user. As the site evolved, many of the
    “Anonymous” users found that they had certain goals and political views in common.
    The message board on [4chan.org](http://4chan.org), mainly a message board called
    /b/, is for the posting of random information that contains calls to action. While
    Anonymous has been involved in a number of data breaches, they are mainly known
    for distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks on government, religious, and
    corporate websites. Some of the high-profile targets of such attacks include the
    Westboro Baptist Church, Church of Scientology, PayPal, MasterCard, and Visa [[12](#bb0065)].
    Many members of Anonymous learned of the Sony lawsuit against George Hotz on the
    site, and ongoing operations were often discussed and coordinated on 4chan, but
    Anonymous now shares operational details on [Pastebin.com](http://Pastebin.com).
    Pastebin was developed as a site to share information for a certain period of
    time [[13](#bb0070)], but it's unclear that the developers ever dreamed that it
    would become the focal point of an ongoing Anonymous operation at it is today.
    Anonymous and Anonymous-associated hacking groups also use the site to dump personal
    information about their enemies, known in the Internet underworld as doxing, and
    share confidential information taken from data breaches such as e-mail, passwords,
    usernames, and password hashes.

    appears that nation-states have used patriotic hackers and hacker gangs to further
    their national interest. We refer to these actions as cyber war as well. Cyber
    war has recently become a hot button issue, with most of the blame for intrusions
    being directed to the Chinese government. What we today call cyber war is not
    new. Titan Rain is the code name given to a series of coordinated attacks on American
    computer systems, attributed to the Chinese government, since 2003 by the US government
    [[14](#bb0075)].

    in Estonia in 2007, when a disagreement with Russia over the relocation of the
    “Bronze Soldier of Tallinn” and war graves in Tallinn (the capital of Estonia)
    resulted in a series of massive coordinated cyber attacks on the Estonian public
    and private sectors. Estonian banks, parliament, ministries, newspapers, and TV
    were knocked offline [[15](#bb0080)].

    weapons being used in what we now call cyber war. The most notable of these new
    “cyber weapons” is Stuxnet [[16](#bb0085)]. Stuxnet targeted centrifuges at the
    Natanz uranium enrichment plant in Iran. The cyber attack set back the Iranian
    nuclear program years according to some experts. It also might have saved lives
    since conventional military action was not necessary to destroy the centrifuges
    [[17](#bb0090)].

    businesses and other organizations. In September 2010, a number of Canadian-based
    law firms where reportedly breached by China-based hackers looking to derail the
    $40 billion acquisition of the world's largest potash producer by an Australian
    mining company [[18](#bb0095)]. On February 18, 2013, the Internet security firm
    Mandiant released a report, which claims that it has hard evidence that the Chinese
    army is behind supplicated intrusions into US networks to steal sensitive data
    and trade secrets from both governmental and nongovernmental organizations [[19](#bb0100)].

    showing off to other hackers. While the common use of the word hacker today refers
    to someone who breaks into computers, the word originally came out the student
    culture at MIT in the 1970s. If a student came up with a particularly eloquent
    solution to a complicated problem in the fewest steps, they were called a hacker,
    and the solution was called a hack. Later, the word hacker was applied to complicated
    practical jokes the students played on the MIT administration. These pranks date
    back to 1947 when the students of MIT used primer cord to burn the letters MIT
    in the football field at Harvard. Other pranks included putting a replica of an
    MIT police car on top of a campus building complete with flashing blue lights
    [[21](#bb0110)].
