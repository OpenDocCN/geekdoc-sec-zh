    employees and the organization itself. But before the benefits of security can
    be realized, staff must be properly informed of their roles, responsibilities,

    sound security is no accident. Companies that consider security from the start

    credit card numbers, sensitive information pervades every part of many companies.
    Business executives often ask how to manage confidential information. The key
    first step is to start with security. Factor it into the decision-making in every
    department of the organization including personnel, sales, accounting, information
    technology. Collecting and maintaining information just because it can be collected
    is no longer a sound business strategy. Savvy companies think through the implications
    of their data decisions. Making conscious choices about the kind of information
    to collect, how long to keep it, and who can access it, can reduce the risk of
    a data compromise down the road. Of course, all of those decisions will depend
    on the nature of the business.

    But once the deal is done, it may be unwise to keep it. In the Federal Trade Commission’s
    (FTC’s) BJ’s Wholesale Club case, the company collected customers’ credit and
    debit card information to process transactions in its retail stores. But according
    to the complaint, it continued to store that data for up to 30 days, long after
    the sale was complete. Not only did that violate bank rules but, by holding on
    to the information without a legitimate business need, the FTC said BJ’s Wholesale
    Club created an unreasonable risk. By exploiting other weaknesses in the company’s
    security practices, hackers stole the account data and used it to make counterfeit
    credit and debit cards. The business could have limited its risk by securely disposing
    of the financial information once it no longer had a legitimate need for it.

    information stored in paper files and on its network. As a result, a group of
    employees transferred more than 7,000 consumer files containing sensitive information
    to third parties without authorization. The company could have prevented that
    misstep by implementing proper controls and ensuring that only authorized employees
    with a business need had access to people’s personal information.

    That’s why it’s wise to give some thought to the password standards you implement.
    In the Twitter case, for example, the company let employees use common dictionary
    words as administrative passwords, as well as passwords they were already using
    for other accounts. According to the FTC, those lax practices left Twitter’s system
    vulnerable to hackers who used password-guessing tools or tried passwords stolen
    from other services in the hope that Twitter employees used the same password
    to access the company’s system. Twitter could have limited those risks by implementing
    a more secure password system, for example, by requiring employees to choose complex
    passwords and training them not to use the same or similar passwords for both
    business and personal accounts.

    in a vulnerable format in cookies on their computers. In Twitter, too, the FTC
    said the company failed to establish policies that prohibited employees from storing
    administrative passwords in plain text in personal email accounts. In each of
    those cases, the risks could have been reduced if the companies had policies and
    procedures in place to store credentials securely.

    of sensitive personal information between the customer’s web browser and the business’s
    website server. But once the information reached the server, the company’s service
    provider decrypted it and emailed it in clear, readable text to the company’s
    headquarters and branch offices. That risk could have been prevented by ensuring
    the data was secure throughout its lifecycle and not just during the initial transmission.

    allow hackers to decrypt sensitive information the apps transmitted. Those risks

    which collected stored sensitive data and sent it outside the network every four
    days. In each of these cases, the businesses could have reduced the risk of a
    data compromise, or the breadth of that compromise, by using tools to monitor

    implement readily available secure communication mechanisms in the logging applications
    it pre-installed on its mobile devices. As a result, malicious third-party apps
    could communicate with the logging applications, placing consumers’ text messages,
    location data, and other sensitive information at risk. The company could have

    in contracts with service providers is an important first step, but it is also
    important to build oversight into the process. The FTC Upromise case illustrates
    that point. There, the company hired a service provider to develop a browser toolbar.
    Upromise claimed that the toolbar, which collected consumers’ browsing information
    to provide personalized offers, would use a filter to remove any personally identifiable
    information before transmission. But, according to the FTC, Upromise failed to
    verify that the service provider had implemented the information collection program
    in a manner consistent with Upromise’s privacy and security policies and with
    the terms in the contract designed to protect consumer information. As a result,
    the toolbar collected sensitive personal information—including financial account
    numbers and security codes from secure web pages—and transmitted it in clear text.
    How could the company have reduced that risk? By asking questions and following
    up with the service provider during the development process. [^(12)](#re_TNF-CH004_CIT00012)
