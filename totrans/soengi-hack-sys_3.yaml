    it is helpful to explain why the policies are being put into place. In addition,
    any term that could potentially confuse a reader needs to be defined. By keeping
    things as simple as possible, employee participation becomes a realistic aspiration.

    many computer users may not be trained to use technology properly and what little

    them how to turn on their machines. At most, they may have learned how to use
    a particular piece of software for a specific application. Thus, the majority
    of an organization’s employees would have little understanding of security issues,
    and there would be no reason to expect that to change unless the organization
    does its part to correct the situation and provide appropriate training. Reluctance
    on the part of the organization to adequately prepare employees for making security
    policy a part of the work environment makes the rest of the effort an exercise

    employees and the organization itself. But before the benefits of security can
    be realized, staff must be properly informed of their roles, responsibilities,

    attack, or a natural disaster, it is important to have planned for the potential

    for such troubles is to plan now, because you can never predict exactly when a
    security breach will happen. It could happen in a year, a month, or this afternoon.
    Planning for emergencies beforehand goes beyond good policy. There is no substitute

    Business executives often ask how to manage confidential information. The key

    department of the organization including personnel, sales, accounting, information
    technology. Collecting and maintaining information just because it can be collected
    is no longer a sound business strategy. Savvy companies think through the implications
    of their data decisions. Making conscious choices about the kind of information
    to collect, how long to keep it, and who can access it, can reduce the risk of
    a data compromise down the road. Of course, all of those decisions will depend

    But once the deal is done, it may be unwise to keep it. In the Federal Trade Commission’s
    (FTC’s) BJ’s Wholesale Club case, the company collected customers’ credit and
    debit card information to process transactions in its retail stores. But according
    to the complaint, it continued to store that data for up to 30 days, long after
    the sale was complete. Not only did that violate bank rules but, by holding on
    to the information without a legitimate business need, the FTC said BJ’s Wholesale
    Club created an unreasonable risk. By exploiting other weaknesses in the company’s
    security practices, hackers stole the account data and used it to make counterfeit
    credit and debit cards. The business could have limited its risk by securely disposing
    of the financial information once it no longer had a legitimate need for it.

    words as administrative passwords, as well as passwords they were already using
    for other accounts. According to the FTC, those lax practices left Twitter’s system
    vulnerable to hackers who used password-guessing tools or tried passwords stolen
    from other services in the hope that Twitter employees used the same password
    to access the company’s system. Twitter could have limited those risks by implementing
    a more secure password system, for example, by requiring employees to choose complex
    passwords and training them not to use the same or similar passwords for both

    that point. There, the company hired a service provider to develop a browser toolbar.
    Upromise claimed that the toolbar, which collected consumers’ browsing information
    to provide personalized offers, would use a filter to remove any personally identifiable
    information before transmission. But, according to the FTC, Upromise failed to
    verify that the service provider had implemented the information collection program
    in a manner consistent with Upromise’s privacy and security policies and with
    the terms in the contract designed to protect consumer information. As a result,
    the toolbar collected sensitive personal information—including financial account
    numbers and security codes from secure web pages—and transmitted it in clear text.
