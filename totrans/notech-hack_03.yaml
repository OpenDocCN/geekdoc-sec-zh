    sensitive data right off a corporate network without even touching the network?
    You might think I’m talking about wireless technology, which doesn’t require any
    “touching” at all, but I’m not. Be a good sport and don’t read the two “D” words
    written in big bold letters at the top of this page, and act surprised when I
    tell you hackers can accomplish this without relying on a single bit of technology
    (punny). Or, don’t play along, and pretend not to be surprised. In fact, maybe
    it’s better you go on thinking your personal or corporate secrets aren’t sitting
    exposed in a dumpster somewhere, waiting for a no-tech hacker to snatch them up.
    In that case you better just skip this chapter.

    I know, it’s bad form to use the phrase in the definition of the phrase, but that’s
    what dumpster diving is, or what it *used* to be. These days, diving is optional.
    As this next photo shows, I find interesting stuff just hanging out in the open,
    waiting to be grabbed.

    much schooling. It’s a good bet that he makes a good deal less than $80,000 a
    year, judging from the position’s salary, that he’s looking for a full-time gig,
    and that he’s probably working in the Defense Aerospace industry. Stuff like this
    makes me want to write Foreign Intelligence Service Recruiting for Dummies. Forget
    all the hard work of finding a mark’s name, email address, employer, educational
    background, department of defense affiliation and career aspirations. All it takes
    is a brainless dumpster sweep to find juicy recruiting targets.

    right in The Princess Bride when he said “You keep using that [phrase]. I do not

    like Proprietary Information and Do not disseminate. I vote for splashing every
    document with a clearer tagline like “Put In Parking Lot For Everyone To Read.”
    At least then there’s no confusion about what people are supposed to do when it

    and grab stuff that’s hanging out of it, I’ve got good news. Sometimes if you’re
    really lucky, all you have to do is stand in a parking lot on a windy day and
    wait for sensitive stuff to blow right into your face. That’s exactly what happened
    to my buddy Mike at work one day. He grabbed the offending document and after
    discovering it didn’t belong to his employer, he shared it with me. Now I’m sharing
    it with you.

- en: This bunch of scribble might not look like much to the untrained eye, but any
    techie will tell you that this map outlines everything needed to take control
    of a computer network. The (blurred) IP addresses is a real live address, and
    the username (admin) and password (blurred, beginning with the letters “G” and
    “a”) provide everything needed to log into the machine as an administrator. Another
    password (blurred, beginning with “R0ck3t”) written at the top of the page provides
    access to another private IP address (blurred, ending with “0.57”), and perhaps
    to other machines on the private network. The routing and subnet map along with
    terms like packet filter and strict routing reveal that the scribbler is technically
    adept, while terms like AES128, MD5 and ipsec indicate that he or she is at least
    somewhat security-conscious, but the simple fact remains that this document was
    tossed aside (along with other documents Mike didn’t bother to pluck out of the
    air) as if it were not important.

    box in an attempt to bypass AES-128 encryption and IPSEC to gain access to the
    private network behind it. Even then, he or she would struggle to bypass the security
    of the internal machines, to gain access to the “rocket” box. On the other hand,
    a no-tech hacker can bypass the security of the entire network in moments, just
    by peeling a document off his face and hanging on to it.

    only seen a handful of cases that were this blatant. Most of the time I have to
    really push the limits and actually stick my head into the dumpster and peer inside.
    I discovered the next document in a dumpster on top of an open box of similar
    papers. The doc lists client names, account information, and a handy list of sales
    reps, the commissions they made and their Social Security numbers. A rival company
    might be interested in these documents, but an identity thief would have a field
    day with them.

    it had obviously just been emptied. The scattering of white envelopes left behind
    seemed innocuous enough, until I read the words *healthcare information* in bold
    red lettering. The rough, ripped edge of the envelope shown in the next photo
    seemed to suggest that some dummy had gotten the invoice in the mail, opened it,
    stuffed it back in the envelope and threw it out for a creepy (talented) no-tech
    hacker like me. If this were my invoice, I would have shredded it, then used the
    scraps to line my cat’s litter box—which seems to deter even the most dedicated
    of dumpster divers.

    the other envelopes (like the one shown in the next photo) was *unopened,* and
    each one had a different mailing address.

    Sure enough, the building directory listed the name of the healthcare provider
    I had seen stamped on the discarded envelopes. At that moment I knew that this
    was not a careless patient, but rather a careless healthcare provider.

    for healthcare providers that leaked patient information. A later Google search
    (yes, Google, and not Yahoo, thanks) revealed that the amendment to the Internal
    Revenue Service code of 1986, known by the acronym HIPAA (the Health Insurance
    Portability & Accountability Act) dealt with patient privacy. Specifically, it
    accounts for the “Protection of confidentiality and security of health data through
    setting and enforcing standards” and threatens fines of up to $250,000 for blatant
    abuses of its suggested standards. Although I knew this was not a quarter-million-dollar
    offense, I knew someone somewhere would probably be ticked off to know what this
    company was up to.

    it bears repeating. I see this kind of near-criminal negligence all the time,
    but I hardly ever report it. I know from a moral standpoint that I should, but
    I have rotten luck reporting my finds. I’ve been scolded, threatened with legal
    action and harassed one too many times for trying to do the right thing. So for
    now, I’m out of the reporting game. Instead, I use the edited versions of these
    photos in my books and talks to raise awareness about the seriousness of the problem.
    At least in this way, these photos can serve some sort of positive end.

    fence. A gate lock combined with a dumpster lock isn’t a half-bad idea, but when
    it comes to clamping down on dangerous dumpster docs, the golden rule is to shred
    everything. But shredding is a subjective word. There are lots of varieties of
    shredders, each of which provides a different level of security. A general-purpose
    strip-cut shredder will shred documents into vertical strips which can be easily
    reassembled. A cross cut shredder will cut the vertical strips horizontally. The
    smaller the resultant shred, the harder it is to reassemble the document. For
    example, a basic strip-cut shredder cuts documents into 1/8” by 1 1/8” pieces,
    like the ones shown in this photo.

    and can cut paper, CDs and even credit cards into 3/32 × 5/16 pieces, for better
    than average security. Generally speaking, you’ll get what you pay for. Whatever
    you chose, anything’s better than putting documents in the trash in one piece,
    or laying them in the parking lot.

- en: It’s also smart to know what’s in your trash before the bad guys do. If you’re
    in charge of security for your company, consider at least a weekly visit to your
    dumpster. Get a feel for what’s being tossed and what condition it’s in when it
    lands in the big green box. If you’re a consumer looking to protect your privacy,
    get a personal shredder and have a discussion with your family members about what
    should be shredded before being thrown away. If your family refuses to comply,
    you might consider relocating them. If they are not particularly noisy, you might
    find another great use for a dumpster with a lock on the lid.
