    the risk of social engineering attacks. However, staff training of this type is
    often poorly designed and seldom executed. The reader will be introduced to the
    common mistakes businesses make and how they can be avoided.

- en: In [Chapter 14](CHP014.xhtml), the topic of creating a strong social engineering
    policy was covered in explicit detail. This chapter will now focus on staff awareness
    and training programs. Effective security awareness programs are often overlooked
    and where they are in place, they are frequently unfit for purpose. There may
    well be readers out there who can recall presentations discussing the dangers
    of weak or reused passwords, writing down passwords, leaving a workstation unlocked,
    opening e-mail attachments, giving out personal or sensitive business information
    over the phone, reporting suspicious behavior, not allowing people to tailgate
    behind them and challenging suspicious individuals on the premises. Unfortunately,
    as inevitable as it is that such security training will regularly occur, it is
    almost always ineffective at preventing social engineering attacks. What is worse
    is that it can also in some rare cases be so poorly executed as to have negative
    results on the overall security of the organization.

    enough to warrant significant investment, examining the various flaws that prevent
    programs from achieving their objectives. Various issues such as lack of actual
    “training”, unsuitable management models and programs weak enough to be leveraged
    by attackers will be covered. Next to be discussed is how the general model for
    designing a program could be improved, focusing more on social engineering and
    less on generic security good practices. Elements such as planning, design, development
    and implementation will then be addressed, ensuring that social engineering issues
    are considered at each stage. The different types of awareness and training programs
    such as foundational awareness, foundational training, departmental training and
    individual training will be discussed in detail, including examples of workshop
    and role-play exercises. After that, an essential topic is how to ensure that
    any training has the right amount of impact and how outside assistance could enhance
    the program’s effectiveness.

    fade into the background. After designing an effective program it is essential
    that it is regularly maintained, tested, improved and repeated. This cyclic approach
    to staff awareness training is extremely important, as a social engineer may well
    be waiting patiently for that one staff member to become apathetic and let their
    guard down.

    to any business. The idea of raising people’s awareness of information security
    issues through a combination of presentations, media, newsletters, posters, etc.
    is theoretically sound. Such awareness and training would lay the foundations
    for improving the overall security culture across an organization. However, awareness
    and training programs are notorious for becoming tedious and failing to achieve
    their general objectives, especially that of reducing the opportunity for suffering
    a successful social engineering attack. In fact, the majority of awareness programs
    seldom mention social engineering in any great detail, instead concentrating on
    the fundamentals such as basic company computer usage policies and generic best
    practices. This is not to say that awareness training shouldn’t include these
    general topics, in fact most of them are essential. The problem is that most programs
    don’t expand on these concepts, put them into context or provide any actual “training”
    to deal with the security issues.

- en: One assumption that awareness and training instructors could be making is that
    the “general user” is incapable of absorbing anything more complicated than the
    absolute basics. System administrators regularly curse at the general user’s apparent
    inability to pick strong passwords and almost burst a blood vessel at the discovery
    of passwords written on Post-It notes. Users are informed of policies and procedures
    when it comes to security and the various information security threats the business
    faces, the issue is that this information is rarely absorbed. The problem is not
    the users, it is the training program. This is even more significant when it comes
    to social engineering awareness programs. Some programs will make users aware
    of social engineering issues but rarely inform them of precisely how such attacks
    may occur. There may be some benefit in keeping training as nontechnical as possible,
    but this shouldn’t really apply to social engineering. As has been seen in previous
    chapters, social engineering is about exploiting human nature, which is a concept
    that should be accessible to anyone.

- en: There is a growing belief that awareness training is so ineffective that it
    shouldn’t even be performed at all. Bruce Schneier, renowned security expert and
    industry guru, has commented that *“…training users in security is generally a
    waste of time and the money can be spent better elsewhere.”*. He believes that
    the ineffectiveness of security training stems from the abstract disparity between
    the *“what you know you should be doing now and what the theoretical future benefit
    would be*.*”*. For example, the encouragement of strong passwords to help prevent
    a “possible” attack happening sometime in the future. The idea of preventing a
    possible attack is of little conciliation for the annoyance of having to remember
    multiple complex passwords. Therefore, it far less likely those users would adhere
    to these common best practices. This is even more apparent when it comes to social
    engineering attacks. Users are told never to give out sensitive information such
    as passwords but are not given much information as to why or how someone might
    try to trick them into revealing that information. Not only is there a great gap
    between the good practice advice and the theoretical negative outcome of a success
    attack, there isn’t even a concrete understanding of the attack in the first place.
    Therefore, even if the user is passionate about security best practices, they
    remain vulnerable. For example, a user may know never to give out sensitive company
    information over the phone. However, should they receive a telephone survey about
    social media policies in the workplace, they may end up freely disclosing company
    information. An astute social engineer may ask them *“Are you allowed to browse
    social media websites using your work computer?”*. In answering this seemingly
    harmless question, the user inadvertently reveals whether or not they have outbound
    Internet access. As far as they are concerned, they’ve not given out any sensitive
    information, when in fact outbound Internet access is a key piece of information
    to a social engineer. This example is covered in more detail in [Chapter 10](CHP010.xhtml).
    Had the user been made aware of the clandestine elicitation techniques used and
    the concept of information inference, they would have likely recognized it and
    avoided the disclosure. It could be argued that a strong policy preventing users
    taking part if surveys would have thwarted this attack, but as previous chapters
    have shown there are innumerable ways of achieving the same objective. For example,
    the social engineer may have impersonated a fellow staff member asking *“…had
    they lost access to the Internet?”*. Again, this would reveal whether or not the
    user has outbound Internet access in the first place. If users are not made aware
    of how attacks are performed, then they are unlikely to spot variations.

- en: When considering the possibility of near perfect social engineering attacks,
    can we really expect general users detect them? An attacker could potentially
    plan a series of small attacks to span over several months or even years. [Chapter
    4](CHP004.xhtml) shows how long game attack strategies can be used to obtain sensitive
    information with very little chance of detection. A series of totally harmless
    calls over months is unlikely to be noticed but may very well be paving the path
    for a very elaborate and serious attack. The simple answer is that general users
    can’t be expected to scrutinize every face-to-face verbal interaction they have,
    interrogate every caller on the telephone, or thoroughly check every single e-mail
    for potential trickery. It all comes down to risk and the mitigation thereof.
    Businesses can never totally eliminate risk, but they need to recognize that they
    can reduce it. The potential for highly organized and highly funded criminal groups
    planning and executing an attack over a period of months is relatively low against
    most businesses of small to medium size. However, the chance of receiving general
    phishing e-mails or suspicious telephone calls is relatively high for business
    of all sizes. Therefore, through the awareness and training program, businesses
    are not expected to become immune to social engineering; it simply reduces the
    likelihood of common attacks being successful. If businesses decide not to implement
    awareness and training programs because they can’t stop determined attackers,
    then they will significantly increase the likelihood of amateur attackers successfully
    breaching their security.

- en: Reactive security awareness and training often starts at the end, that is to
    say that it presents the worst-case scenarios and consequences of bad security
    practice and then recommends specific good practice solutions. On the other hand
    a proactive approach to security must start at the beginning with the “what”,
    “who”, “why” and “how” of social engineering. For example, it is common practice
    to stress the importance of challenging an unrecognized person on the premises.
    Perhaps someone wearing a visitors badge has sat down at a hot desk and plugged
    their laptop into the network. Any “security aware” employee would be expected
    to challenge that person. Suppose they decided to do so and received the reply
    *“Oh hi, I’m working with Stuart from IT as the phones are playing up again. He
    said it would be ok to grab one of the hot desks here in HR where it’s a bit quieter,
    is that ok?”*. The staff member is likely to feel that they have completed their
    task, that the person has indeed been challenged and they responded with a known
    contact and plausible story. Challenging is not a natural thing for most people
    and as long as the situation looks right the challenger would rather accept it
    than cope with the unnerving situation of dealing with an impostor. They have
    followed the awareness and training and have acted in a security conscious manner.
    However, the awareness training has not addressed the “what”, “who”, “why” and
    “how” of this security incident. It may be a social engineer trying to gain access
    to the network by impersonating a contractor. The impersonation above consisted
    of a fake visitors badge, gaining credibility from dropping the name of an IT
    staff member and giving the pretext of repairs to the phone system. Therefore,
    a more effective response would be to “complete the challenge.” The individual,
    be them a visitor or contractor, should be able to provide an on-site contact.
    This contact should then be called to confirm the identity of the visitor, as
    they are currently unescorted. Alarm bells should start ringing if they are unable
    to provide a contact for various reasons and the associated department should
    then be called.

- en: It is only when a security incident has been understood from start to finish
    that the concept of how to tackle it can be understood. Significant improvements
    can be made with the introduction of workshop and role-based training to support
    awareness presentations, rather than relying on presentations alone. Suppose the
    awareness presentations informed staff that social engineers often pretend to
    be having an argument on the phone, so as to discourage challengers. Staff will
    now be better equipped to deal with that particular situation. However, the social
    engineer instead arrives on crutches and motions for the door to be kept open.
    This new scenario wasn’t covered and staff members become vulnerable. It is only
    through group led training sessions such as workshops that many different scenarios
    can be explored. There is a fundamental difference between “awareness” and “training”.
    The former is simply presenting a security issue so as to make people aware, which
    often simply involves instructional videos, posters and flyers. The latter is
    a far more practical approach of actually teaching skills. The fact is, most security
    awareness and training programs don’t actually involve any “training”.

- en: When it comes to designing and implementing an awareness and training program,
    the chosen model could have a significant impact on its overall effectiveness.
    As stated in NIST’s “Building an Information Technology Security Awareness and
    Training Program”, *“Most awareness and training programs follow a Centralized
    Program Management Model and are therefore not taking advantage of the insight
    individual departments may have.”*. A centralized model basically consists of
    management overseeing the design, development and implementation of the entire
    program and then passing the results to individual departments. The departments
    would then be responsible for monitoring the effectiveness of the program and
    relaying any results back to management. Such centralized models are most likely
    used for the time-saving benefits and general management convenience. However,
    by not incorporating the insights of each department, there is an increased risk
    of creating a very generic awareness program that fails to make any real impact.
    A preferable option would be to use a “decentralized” model. This moves the responsibility
    of design, development and implementation to each department, leaving management
    to drive the policy and budget. Decentralized models are usually adopted in large
    organisations where it makes more practical sense to have each department manage
    the bulk of the tasks. However, the advantages of this model in terms of social
    engineering, are that it ensures that departmentally specific attacks are discussed
    and appropriate training developed.

- en: From the perspective of an attacker, a standard security awareness training
    program is a double-edged sword. On the one hand it provides staff members with
    a foundational knowledge of general security concepts. If the awareness program
    has been even partially successful then it is unlikely that users will openly
    shout out their personal e-mail passwords across the office, or print off and
    hand over the business’s customer database to the general public on the street.
    On the other hand, as the training is so common place and usually follows the
    same general clichéd security themes, a social engineer can use it to gain credibility
    and adjust their attack scenarios to work with the training rather than against
    it. For example, staff may be used to the idea of not revealing their passwords
    to anyone, even if they’re members of the IT department. A social engineer could
    call the target, impersonate an IT department staff member and claim that they
    had received reports of e-mail accounts being locked out. They are concerned that
    a breach may have occurred and want to ensure that the issue isn’t company wide.
    They would like to see if that staff member is currently locked out and could
    check it remotely for them. They would inform the target that they would obviously
    never ask for a password to be revealed over the phone. Instead, they may ask
    the target to check that they have received the e-mail explaining the security
    concern and if so, to follow the link to ensure they can still log in without
    any issues. The link would of course be malicious and either directly exploit
    vulnerabilities in the target’s web browser or possibly direct them to a clone
    of the company’s e-mail portal, thereby harvesting the user’s credentials. Refer
    to [Chapter 9](CHP009.xhtml) for a full breakdown of this type of attack.

    to deal with them, then it is relatively straightforward to take advantage of
    the awareness and training. A training program may not only be ineffective at
    achieving its general security goals, but can also be so ineffective that it can
    potentially aid attackers rather than defend against them. If this becomes the
    case, then the awareness and training program will be a very expensive waste of
    company time.

- en: In order for any awareness and training program to be at all effective, there
    must be complete buy-in from upper management. This is why the management section
    lies at the very top of the model. The management team will be expected to secure
    and provide a suitable budget based on discussions with each department. The decentralised
    model puts the responsibility on each department to assess their individual risks
    and requirements and relay this back to management. Management is also responsible
    for creating and enforcing the company policies that form a great deal of the
    foundation for the topics covered in the program (See [Chapter 14](CHP014.xhtml)
    for a full breakdown of creating hardened policies and procedures). However, from
    a social engineering standpoint, management buy-in has a far greater importance.
    Management roles are high value targets for social engineers for the purposes
    of both impersonation and access to high privileges. For example, there may be
    procedures in place to validate callers before providing information or performing
    tasks. If management decides to “pull rank” and pressure the employee into waiving
    the procedure because they can’t remember their employee number, then the social
    engineer can do exactly the same. Equally, if additional security controls such
    as two-factor authentication have been implemented on e-mail accounts, they must
    also apply to and be fully supported by management, as their accounts will likely
    be the first to be targeted. All too often management figures may believe that
    they are too important for basic procedures such as screen saver locks or complex
    passwords, or they perceive them as too much of an inconvenience. Managers must
    appreciate how their roles make them unique targets to a social engineer. Therefore,
    management has a greater responsibility to ensure they are fully involved in the
    program and not just there to create policies and assign budget.

    and training program is aligned with the business’s requirements, stays within
    scope and ultimately supports its mission. This is all the more necessary to ensure
    that it does not end up being generic training that fails to grab the attention
    of staff members. The program should directly correlate the business’s critical
    assets with the most significant risks they face as a whole. One particular business
    may have to deal with the crippling risk of web server denial-of-service (DoS)
    attacks, which would cause them to lose millions of dollars. Another business
    may consider their customer database to be their primary asset, where a social
    engineer invasion would result in unrecoverable loss of confidence from its clients.
    These events are normally associated with traditional malicious hackers utilizing
    exploit code and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. However, social
    engineering could also be used to gain remote access into the network, disable
    the web server and access the customer database. Whatever the asset, threat, vulnerability,
    or risk a business faces, it should be clearly reflected in the awareness and
    training program that is designed. This should not be confused with the risks
    each individual department faces. These should be the overall risks for the company

    in very different ways. A receptionist may be targeted via telephone to arrange
    a meeting or to obtain a door pass. A finance administrator may be targeted in
    person and tricked into providing access to the corporate database. Previous chapters
    have clearly demonstrated how different objectives require different scenarios.
    There is a great breadth to social engineering attacks in terms of both potential
    complexity and creativity. Therefore, staff members from different departments
    will require very different training. For example, receptionists are arguably
    the most targeted individuals in the business. They are trained to be helpful
    and quite rightly so. They will often hold the keys or information a social engineer
    needs to access the building’s restricted areas. The type of training aimed at
    a receptionist’s role would focus on elicitation techniques specific to their
    role (i.e. via telephone and physical security elements such as fake badges and
    tailgating). The training would mainly cover the various techniques used to gain
    access to the building. This type of training would be quite different to that
    aimed at the chief executive’s role. Their training would more likely be focused
    on spear phishing attacks and credential harvesting techniques, after all, gaining
    access to the chief executive’s e-mail account could have devastating results.
    Therefore, the chief executive’s training might be more technically focused (i.e.
    remote attack, e-mail attack vectors). The risk exponentially increases where
    a third party is involved, as it makes it easier to impersonate staff members
    they have never met. A third party’s training would focus on how attackers may
    attempt to circumvent the current procedures for resetting passwords. However,
    this is not to say that a business shouldn’t take receptionists through spear
    phishing attacks, nor chief executives and help desk technicians through the dangers
    of tailgating. It is simply that the more focused and targeted the training program
    is, the more likely it is to succeed in achieving its aims.

    security. There are many ways this can be accomplished, such as quantitative and
    qualitative methods, expressing risk objectively and subjectively. Risk assessment
    methodologies are beyond the scope of this book, however, it is important to understand
    their significant role in creating effective awareness and training material.
    The risks to an individual department will vary greatly from one department to
    another. The finance department may consider loss of integrity with their database
    as the greatest risk. Whereas the human resources department may deem the loss
    of confidentiality in staff records as their greatest risk. These general risks
    are important and they will inevitably be included in the foundational awareness
    and training. However, these are general departmental risks whereas, from a social
    engineering perspective, there may be additional concerns. For example, in terms
    of social engineering attacks, the IT department faces the risk of being impersonated
    for their privileges. The sales department may be at risk of remote telephone
    attacks aimed at leveraging their desire to make sales. The salesman may be sent
    an e-mail with a promising lead only a click away. These types of social engineering
    risks may not be immediately obvious to each department, especially if they have
    had no prior experience with social engineering. It is also important to establish
    who will be responsible for the risk assessment process. Will the management take
    responsibility for the process or will a third party be hired? Both general and
    social engineering risks should be identified and used as the basis for the departmentally
    specific training sections of the program.

    The results of that process should be incorporated into the awareness and training
    program. It should be clearly shown how seemingly solid procedures can be vulnerable
    to attack, how the business’s own procedures have been tested and hardened, and
    what specific procedures within each department may be targeted. By walking staff
    through each stage as above, they will be better equipped to detect variations
    in attacks and spot new weaknesses in procedures that may have been missed. There
    is also far less chance of staff misunderstanding the security implications of
    procedures or taking shortcuts for the sake of convenience.

    weaknesses with that program. Previous chapters have discussed in great detail
    the various benefits of performing assessments, however, when it comes to awareness

    unlikely risks need to be mitigated. Professional social engineers could be hired

    may be hired to target specific individuals or design elaborate scenarios involving
    multiple blended attack vectors. The results of assessments of this type would

    ill equipped to detect attacks, and even less so to prevent them. While security
    experts debate over whether or not awareness training should even be performed,
    social engineering training is pushed further and further to the back burner.
    The worrying issue here is that awareness and training programs are a truly critical
    part of a company’s defense against social engineering type attacks. There is
    only so much that technology, hardened policies and hardened procedures can achieve.
    If businesses are to effectively defend themselves from social engineering, they
    need to properly train the individuals that are being targeted. However, it is
    important to ensure that the program is properly designed, tested and regularly
    improved, so as not to have weaknesses that could be leveraged by attackers.
