  zh: 介绍
- en: In [Chapter 14](CHP014.xhtml), the topic of creating a strong social engineering
    policy was covered in explicit detail. This chapter will now focus on staff awareness
    and training programs. Effective security awareness programs are often overlooked
    and where they are in place, they are frequently unfit for purpose. There may
    well be readers out there who can recall presentations discussing the dangers
    of weak or reused passwords, writing down passwords, leaving a workstation unlocked,
    opening e-mail attachments, giving out personal or sensitive business information
    over the phone, reporting suspicious behavior, not allowing people to tailgate
    behind them and challenging suspicious individuals on the premises. Unfortunately,
    as inevitable as it is that such security training will regularly occur, it is
    almost always ineffective at preventing social engineering attacks. What is worse
    is that it can also in some rare cases be so poorly executed as to have negative
    results on the overall security of the organization.

  zh: 在[第14章](CHP014.xhtml)中，详细介绍了建立强大社会工程政策的主题。本章将重点关注员工意识和培训计划。有效的安全意识计划经常被忽视，而且即使存在，也经常不符合要求。可能有读者还记得过去讨论过弱密码或重复使用密码、写下密码、将工作站解锁、打开电子邮件附件、在电话中提供个人或敏感业务信息、报告可疑行为、不允许别人在身后跟随以及在场所内质疑可疑个体的演示。不幸的是，尽管这样的安全培训经常发生，但几乎总是无法有效防止社会工程攻击。更糟糕的是，在一些罕见情况下，这种安全培训执行得如此糟糕，以至于对组织的整体安全产生负面影响。
- en: This chapter will discuss whether awareness and training programs are beneficial
    enough to warrant significant investment, examining the various flaws that prevent
    programs from achieving their objectives. Various issues such as lack of actual
    “training”, unsuitable management models and programs weak enough to be leveraged
    by attackers will be covered. Next to be discussed is how the general model for
    designing a program could be improved, focusing more on social engineering and
    less on generic security good practices. Elements such as planning, design, development
    and implementation will then be addressed, ensuring that social engineering issues
    are considered at each stage. The different types of awareness and training programs
    such as foundational awareness, foundational training, departmental training and
    individual training will be discussed in detail, including examples of workshop
    and role-play exercises. After that, an essential topic is how to ensure that
    any training has the right amount of impact and how outside assistance could enhance
    the program’s effectiveness.

  zh: 本章将讨论意识和培训计划是否足够有益，值得进行重大投资，检查导致计划无法实现目标的各种缺陷。将涵盖各种问题，如缺乏实际的“培训”，不适合的管理模式以及容易被攻击者利用的计划。接下来将讨论如何改进设计计划的一般模型，更加关注社会工程学，而不是通用的安全良好实践。然后将讨论规划、设计、开发和实施等要素，确保在每个阶段考虑社会工程问题。将详细讨论不同类型的意识和培训计划，如基础意识、基础培训、部门培训和个人培训，包括研讨会和角色扮演练习的示例。之后，一个重要的话题是如何确保任何培训产生足够的影响，并且外部协助如何提高计划的有效性。
- en: Finally, the chapter will focus on how to ensure that a training program doesn’t
    fade into the background. After designing an effective program it is essential
    that it is regularly maintained, tested, improved and repeated. This cyclic approach
    to staff awareness training is extremely important, as a social engineer may well
    be waiting patiently for that one staff member to become apathetic and let their
    guard down.

  zh: 当前意识培训
- en: There is no doubt that security awareness training can potentially be beneficial
    to any business. The idea of raising people’s awareness of information security
    issues through a combination of presentations, media, newsletters, posters, etc.
    is theoretically sound. Such awareness and training would lay the foundations
    for improving the overall security culture across an organization. However, awareness
    and training programs are notorious for becoming tedious and failing to achieve
    their general objectives, especially that of reducing the opportunity for suffering
    a successful social engineering attack. In fact, the majority of awareness programs
    seldom mention social engineering in any great detail, instead concentrating on
    the fundamentals such as basic company computer usage policies and generic best
    practices. This is not to say that awareness training shouldn’t include these
    general topics, in fact most of them are essential. The problem is that most programs
    don’t expand on these concepts, put them into context or provide any actual “training”
    to deal with the security issues.

  zh: 毫无疑问，安全意识培训对任何企业都有潜在的益处。通过演示、媒体、通讯、海报等方式提高人们对信息安全问题的意识的理念在理论上是合理的。这种意识和培训将为改善组织整体安全文化奠定基础。然而，意识和培训计划以变得乏味和未能实现其一般目标而臭名昭著，尤其是减少遭受成功的社会工程攻击的机会。事实上，大多数意识计划很少详细讨论社会工程，而是集中于基本的公司计算机使用政策和通用最佳实践等基础知识。这并不是说意识培训不应包括这些一般主题，事实上大部分都是必不可少的。问题在于大多数计划没有扩展这些概念，将其置于背景中或提供任何实际的“培训”来处理安全问题。
- en: One assumption that awareness and training instructors could be making is that
    the “general user” is incapable of absorbing anything more complicated than the
    absolute basics. System administrators regularly curse at the general user’s apparent
    inability to pick strong passwords and almost burst a blood vessel at the discovery
    of passwords written on Post-It notes. Users are informed of policies and procedures
    when it comes to security and the various information security threats the business
    faces, the issue is that this information is rarely absorbed. The problem is not
    the users, it is the training program. This is even more significant when it comes
    to social engineering awareness programs. Some programs will make users aware
    of social engineering issues but rarely inform them of precisely how such attacks
    may occur. There may be some benefit in keeping training as nontechnical as possible,
    but this shouldn’t really apply to social engineering. As has been seen in previous
    chapters, social engineering is about exploiting human nature, which is a concept
    that should be accessible to anyone.

  zh: 一个假设是，意识和培训导师可能认为“普通用户”无法吸收比绝对基础更复杂的任何东西。系统管理员经常对普通用户明显无法选择强密码而咒骂，并且几乎因发现密码写在便利贴上而气得要爆血管。用户在涉及安全性和企业面临的各种信息安全威胁时被告知政策和程序，问题在于这些信息很少被吸收。问题不在于用户，而在于培训计划。当涉及社会工程意识计划时，这甚至更为重要。一些计划会让用户意识到社会工程问题，但很少告诉他们这类攻击可能如何发生。保持培训尽可能非技术性可能会有一些好处，但这实际上不应该适用于社会工程。如前几章所述，社会工程是利用人类本性，这是一个任何人都应该能够理解的概念。

  zh: 我们甚至应该进行意识培训吗？
- en: There is a growing belief that awareness training is so ineffective that it
    shouldn’t even be performed at all. Bruce Schneier, renowned security expert and
    industry guru, has commented that *“…training users in security is generally a
    waste of time and the money can be spent better elsewhere.”*. He believes that
    the ineffectiveness of security training stems from the abstract disparity between
    the *“what you know you should be doing now and what the theoretical future benefit
    would be*.*”*. For example, the encouragement of strong passwords to help prevent
    a “possible” attack happening sometime in the future. The idea of preventing a
    possible attack is of little conciliation for the annoyance of having to remember
    multiple complex passwords. Therefore, it far less likely those users would adhere
    to these common best practices. This is even more apparent when it comes to social
    engineering attacks. Users are told never to give out sensitive information such
    as passwords but are not given much information as to why or how someone might
    try to trick them into revealing that information. Not only is there a great gap
    between the good practice advice and the theoretical negative outcome of a success
    attack, there isn’t even a concrete understanding of the attack in the first place.
    Therefore, even if the user is passionate about security best practices, they
    remain vulnerable. For example, a user may know never to give out sensitive company
    information over the phone. However, should they receive a telephone survey about
    social media policies in the workplace, they may end up freely disclosing company
    information. An astute social engineer may ask them *“Are you allowed to browse
    social media websites using your work computer?”*. In answering this seemingly
    harmless question, the user inadvertently reveals whether or not they have outbound
    Internet access. As far as they are concerned, they’ve not given out any sensitive
    information, when in fact outbound Internet access is a key piece of information
    to a social engineer. This example is covered in more detail in [Chapter 10](CHP010.xhtml).
    Had the user been made aware of the clandestine elicitation techniques used and
    the concept of information inference, they would have likely recognized it and
    avoided the disclosure. It could be argued that a strong policy preventing users
    taking part if surveys would have thwarted this attack, but as previous chapters
    have shown there are innumerable ways of achieving the same objective. For example,
    the social engineer may have impersonated a fellow staff member asking *“…had
    they lost access to the Internet?”*. Again, this would reveal whether or not the
    user has outbound Internet access in the first place. If users are not made aware
    of how attacks are performed, then they are unlikely to spot variations.

  zh: 越来越多的人认为意识培训是如此无效，以至于根本不应该进行。著名安全专家和行业大师布鲁斯·施奈尔曾评论说*“……对用户进行安全培训通常是浪费时间，这些钱可以更好地用在其他地方。”*。他认为安全培训的无效性源于*“你知道现在应该做什么和理论上未来的好处之间的抽象差距*。”。例如，鼓励使用强密码以帮助预防“可能”在未来某个时候发生的攻击。预防可能攻击的想法对于要记住多个复杂密码的烦恼来说几乎毫无安慰。因此，用户遵循这些常见的最佳实践的可能性要小得多。当涉及社会工程攻击时，这一点更加明显。用户被告知永远不要泄露诸如密码之类的敏感信息，但却没有得到太多关于为什么或如何有人可能试图欺骗他们透露这些信息的信息。不仅在良好实践建议和成功攻击的理论负面结果之间存在巨大差距，甚至对于攻击本身的具体理解也没有。因此，即使用户对安全最佳实践充满热情，他们仍然容易受到攻击。例如，用户可能知道永远不要在电话中泄露敏感的公司信息。然而，如果他们接到有关工作场所社交媒体政策的电话调查，他们可能会自由地透露公司信息。一个敏锐的社会工程师可能会问他们*“您是否允许使用工作电脑浏览社交媒体网站？”*。在回答这个看似无害的问题时，用户无意中透露了他们是否有出站互联网访问权限。在他们看来，他们并没有泄露任何敏感信息，而事实上出站互联网访问是社会工程师的关键信息之一。这个例子在[第10章](CHP010.xhtml)中有更详细的介绍。如果用户意识到了使用的秘密引诱技术和信息推断的概念，他们很可能会意识到并避免泄露。可以说，一项严格的政策阻止用户参与调查将阻止这种攻击，但正如前几章所示，有无数种实现相同目标的方法。例如，社会工程师可能会冒充一位同事询问*“……他们是否失去了对互联网的访问？”*。同样，这将揭示用户是否首先具有出站互联网访问权限。如果用户不了解攻击是如何执行的，那么他们不太可能发现变化。
- en: When considering the possibility of near perfect social engineering attacks,
    can we really expect general users detect them? An attacker could potentially
    plan a series of small attacks to span over several months or even years. [Chapter
    4](CHP004.xhtml) shows how long game attack strategies can be used to obtain sensitive
    information with very little chance of detection. A series of totally harmless
    calls over months is unlikely to be noticed but may very well be paving the path
    for a very elaborate and serious attack. The simple answer is that general users
    can’t be expected to scrutinize every face-to-face verbal interaction they have,
    interrogate every caller on the telephone, or thoroughly check every single e-mail
    for potential trickery. It all comes down to risk and the mitigation thereof.
    Businesses can never totally eliminate risk, but they need to recognize that they
    can reduce it. The potential for highly organized and highly funded criminal groups
    planning and executing an attack over a period of months is relatively low against
    most businesses of small to medium size. However, the chance of receiving general
    phishing e-mails or suspicious telephone calls is relatively high for business
    of all sizes. Therefore, through the awareness and training program, businesses
    are not expected to become immune to social engineering; it simply reduces the
    likelihood of common attacks being successful. If businesses decide not to implement
    awareness and training programs because they can’t stop determined attackers,
    then they will significantly increase the likelihood of amateur attackers successfully
    breaching their security.

  zh: 在考虑近乎完美的社会工程攻击可能性时，我们真的能指望一般用户能够检测到它们吗？攻击者可能会计划一系列小攻击，持续数月甚至数年。[第四章](CHP004.xhtml)展示了长期攻击策略如何可以在很少被察觉的情况下获取敏感信息。数月间一系列完全无害的通话不太可能被注意到，但很可能正在为一个非常精心策划且严重的攻击铺平道路。简单的答案是一般用户不能期望他们会仔细审查每一次面对面的口头交流，盘问每一个打来电话的人，或者彻底检查每一封电子邮件是否存在潜在的诡计。一切都归结于风险及其减轻。企业永远无法完全消除风险，但他们需要意识到他们可以减少风险。高度组织化和资金充足的犯罪团伙在数月内策划和执行攻击的可能性相对较低，针对大多数中小型企业。然而，各种规模的企业接收到一般钓鱼邮件或可疑电话的机会相对较高。因此，通过意识和培训计划，企业并不指望能够免疫社会工程攻击；它只是降低了常见攻击成功的可能性。如果企业决定不实施意识和培训计划，因为他们无法阻止决心坚定的攻击者，那么他们将大大增加业余攻击者成功侵犯他们安全的可能性。

- en: Reactive security awareness and training often starts at the end, that is to
    say that it presents the worst-case scenarios and consequences of bad security
    practice and then recommends specific good practice solutions. On the other hand
    a proactive approach to security must start at the beginning with the “what”,
    “who”, “why” and “how” of social engineering. For example, it is common practice
    to stress the importance of challenging an unrecognized person on the premises.
    Perhaps someone wearing a visitors badge has sat down at a hot desk and plugged
    their laptop into the network. Any “security aware” employee would be expected
    to challenge that person. Suppose they decided to do so and received the reply
    *“Oh hi, I’m working with Stuart from IT as the phones are playing up again. He
    said it would be ok to grab one of the hot desks here in HR where it’s a bit quieter,
    is that ok?”*. The staff member is likely to feel that they have completed their
    task, that the person has indeed been challenged and they responded with a known
    contact and plausible story. Challenging is not a natural thing for most people
    and as long as the situation looks right the challenger would rather accept it
    than cope with the unnerving situation of dealing with an impostor. They have
    followed the awareness and training and have acted in a security conscious manner.
    However, the awareness training has not addressed the “what”, “who”, “why” and
    “how” of this security incident. It may be a social engineer trying to gain access
    to the network by impersonating a contractor. The impersonation above consisted
    of a fake visitors badge, gaining credibility from dropping the name of an IT
    staff member and giving the pretext of repairs to the phone system. Therefore,
    a more effective response would be to “complete the challenge.” The individual,
    be them a visitor or contractor, should be able to provide an on-site contact.
    This contact should then be called to confirm the identity of the visitor, as
    they are currently unescorted. Alarm bells should start ringing if they are unable
    to provide a contact for various reasons and the associated department should
    then be called.

  zh: 反应性安全意识和培训通常从最终开始，也就是说，它呈现了最坏的情况和不良安全实践的后果，然后推荐具体的良好实践解决方案。另一方面，对安全的积极态度必须从社会工程学的“什么”，“谁”，“为什么”和“如何”开始。例如，强调挑战未被识别的人进入场所的重要性是常见做法。也许一个佩戴访客徽章的人坐在热座位上，把笔记本电脑插入了网络。任何“安全意识强”的员工都会被期望挑战那个人。假设他们决定这样做，并收到回答*“哦，嗨，我和IT的斯图尔特一起工作，因为电话又出问题了。他说可以在人力资源部拿一个热座位，这样会安静一些，可以吗？”*。员工可能会觉得他们已经完成了任务，那个人确实受到了挑战，并且他们以一个已知的联系人和合理的故事回应了。对大多数人来说，挑战并不是一件自然的事情，只要情况看起来合适，挑战者宁愿接受它，而不是应对一个冒名顶替者的紧张局面。他们遵循了意识和培训，并以一种安全意识的方式行事。然而，意识培训并没有解决这起安全事件的“什么”，“谁”，“为什么”和“如何”。这可能是一名社会工程师试图通过冒充承包商来获取对网络的访问权限。上述冒名行骗包括伪造的访客徽章，通过提及IT工作人员的名字获得可信度，并提出对电话系统的维修借口。因此，更有效的反应将是“完成挑战”。个人，无论是访客还是承包商，都应该能够提供一个现场联系人。然后应该打电话确认访客的身份，因为他们目前是未陪同的。如果他们由于各种原因无法提供联系方式，则相关部门应立即被通知。
- en: It is only when a security incident has been understood from start to finish
    that the concept of how to tackle it can be understood. Significant improvements
    can be made with the introduction of workshop and role-based training to support
    awareness presentations, rather than relying on presentations alone. Suppose the
    awareness presentations informed staff that social engineers often pretend to
    be having an argument on the phone, so as to discourage challengers. Staff will
    now be better equipped to deal with that particular situation. However, the social
    engineer instead arrives on crutches and motions for the door to be kept open.
    This new scenario wasn’t covered and staff members become vulnerable. It is only
    through group led training sessions such as workshops that many different scenarios
    can be explored. There is a fundamental difference between “awareness” and “training”.
    The former is simply presenting a security issue so as to make people aware, which
    often simply involves instructional videos, posters and flyers. The latter is
    a far more practical approach of actually teaching skills. The fact is, most security
    awareness and training programs don’t actually involve any “training”.

  zh: 选择错误的管理模式
- en: When it comes to designing and implementing an awareness and training program,
    the chosen model could have a significant impact on its overall effectiveness.
    As stated in NIST’s “Building an Information Technology Security Awareness and
    Training Program”, *“Most awareness and training programs follow a Centralized
    Program Management Model and are therefore not taking advantage of the insight
    individual departments may have.”*. A centralized model basically consists of
    management overseeing the design, development and implementation of the entire
    program and then passing the results to individual departments. The departments
    would then be responsible for monitoring the effectiveness of the program and
    relaying any results back to management. Such centralized models are most likely
    used for the time-saving benefits and general management convenience. However,
    by not incorporating the insights of each department, there is an increased risk
    of creating a very generic awareness program that fails to make any real impact.
    A preferable option would be to use a “decentralized” model. This moves the responsibility
    of design, development and implementation to each department, leaving management
    to drive the policy and budget. Decentralized models are usually adopted in large
    organisations where it makes more practical sense to have each department manage
    the bulk of the tasks. However, the advantages of this model in terms of social
    engineering, are that it ensures that departmentally specific attacks are discussed
    and appropriate training developed.

  zh: 在设计和实施意识和培训计划时，所选择的模式可能会对其整体有效性产生重大影响。正如NIST的“构建信息技术安全意识和培训计划”中所述，“大多数意识和培训计划都遵循集中式程序管理模式，因此没有利用个别部门可能具有的洞察力。”集中式模型基本上由管理层监督整个计划的设计、开发和实施，然后将结果传递给各个部门。各部门随后将负责监控计划的有效性，并将任何结果传达回管理层。这种集中式模型最可能用于节省时间和一般管理的方便。然而，通过不整合每个部门的见解，存在着创建一个不会产生任何真正影响的非常通用的意识计划的风险增加。一个更可取的选择是使用“分散式”模型。这将设计、开发和实施的责任移交给每个部门，使管理层负责制定政策和预算。分散式模型通常在大型组织中采用，在这些组织中，让每个部门管理大部分任务更具实际意义。然而，该模型在社会工程方面的优势在于确保讨论部门特定的攻击，并制定适当的培训。

  zh: 利用薄弱的培训计划
- en: From the perspective of an attacker, a standard security awareness training
    program is a double-edged sword. On the one hand it provides staff members with
    a foundational knowledge of general security concepts. If the awareness program
    has been even partially successful then it is unlikely that users will openly
    shout out their personal e-mail passwords across the office, or print off and
    hand over the business’s customer database to the general public on the street.
    On the other hand, as the training is so common place and usually follows the
    same general clichéd security themes, a social engineer can use it to gain credibility
    and adjust their attack scenarios to work with the training rather than against
    it. For example, staff may be used to the idea of not revealing their passwords
    to anyone, even if they’re members of the IT department. A social engineer could
    call the target, impersonate an IT department staff member and claim that they
    had received reports of e-mail accounts being locked out. They are concerned that
    a breach may have occurred and want to ensure that the issue isn’t company wide.
    They would like to see if that staff member is currently locked out and could
    check it remotely for them. They would inform the target that they would obviously
    never ask for a password to be revealed over the phone. Instead, they may ask
    the target to check that they have received the e-mail explaining the security
    concern and if so, to follow the link to ensure they can still log in without
    any issues. The link would of course be malicious and either directly exploit

  zh: 从攻击者的角度来看，一个标准的安全意识培训计划是一把双刃剑。一方面，它为员工提供了一般安全概念的基础知识。如果意识计划甚至部分成功，那么用户不太可能在办公室里大声喊出他们的个人电子邮件密码，或者打印出并交给大众公司的客户数据库。另一方面，由于培训是如此普遍，并且通常遵循相同的一般陈词滥调的安全主题，社会工程师可以利用它来获得信誉，并调整他们的攻击方案以与培训配合而不是反对它。例如，员工可能习惯于不向任何人透露他们的密码，即使是
    IT 部门的成员也是如此。社会工程师可能会打电话给目标，冒充 IT 部门的工作人员，并声称他们收到了电子邮件帐户被锁定的报告。他们担心可能发生了漏洞，并希望确保该问题不是公司范围的。他们想要查看该员工当前是否被锁定，并可以远程检查。他们会告诉目标，他们显然不会要求通过电话透露密码。相反，他们可能会要求目标检查是否收到了解释安全问题的电子邮件，并且如果收到了，可以点击链接以确保他们仍然可以登录而没有任何问题。链接当然是恶意的，可以直接利用目标的网络浏览器中的漏洞，或者可能将其引导到公司电子邮件门户的克隆，从而收集用户的凭据。请参阅[第

    the awareness and training. A training program may not only be ineffective at
    achieving its general security goals, but can also be so ineffective that it can
    potentially aid attackers rather than defend against them. If this becomes the

- en: In order for any awareness and training program to be at all effective, there
    must be complete buy-in from upper management. This is why the management section
    lies at the very top of the model. The management team will be expected to secure
    and provide a suitable budget based on discussions with each department. The decentralised
    model puts the responsibility on each department to assess their individual risks
    and requirements and relay this back to management. Management is also responsible
    for creating and enforcing the company policies that form a great deal of the
    foundation for the topics covered in the program (See [Chapter 14](CHP014.xhtml)
    for a full breakdown of creating hardened policies and procedures). However, from
    a social engineering standpoint, management buy-in has a far greater importance.
    Management roles are high value targets for social engineers for the purposes
    of both impersonation and access to high privileges. For example, there may be
    procedures in place to validate callers before providing information or performing
    tasks. If management decides to “pull rank” and pressure the employee into waiving
    the procedure because they can’t remember their employee number, then the social
    engineer can do exactly the same. Equally, if additional security controls such
    as two-factor authentication have been implemented on e-mail accounts, they must
    also apply to and be fully supported by management, as their accounts will likely
    be the first to be targeted. All too often management figures may believe that
    they are too important for basic procedures such as screen saver locks or complex
    passwords, or they perceive them as too much of an inconvenience. Managers must
    appreciate how their roles make them unique targets to a social engineer. Therefore,
    management has a greater responsibility to ensure they are fully involved in the
    program and not just there to create policies and assign budget.

    exploit code and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. However, social
    engineering could also be used to gain remote access into the network, disable
    the web server and access the customer database. Whatever the asset, threat, vulnerability,

- en: Social engineers will target different staff members, in various departments,
    in very different ways. A receptionist may be targeted via telephone to arrange
    a meeting or to obtain a door pass. A finance administrator may be targeted in
    person and tricked into providing access to the corporate database. Previous chapters
    have clearly demonstrated how different objectives require different scenarios.
    There is a great breadth to social engineering attacks in terms of both potential
    complexity and creativity. Therefore, staff members from different departments
    will require very different training. For example, receptionists are arguably
    the most targeted individuals in the business. They are trained to be helpful
    and quite rightly so. They will often hold the keys or information a social engineer
    needs to access the building’s restricted areas. The type of training aimed at
    a receptionist’s role would focus on elicitation techniques specific to their
    role (i.e. via telephone and physical security elements such as fake badges and
    tailgating). The training would mainly cover the various techniques used to gain
    access to the building. This type of training would be quite different to that
    aimed at the chief executive’s role. Their training would more likely be focused
    on spear phishing attacks and credential harvesting techniques, after all, gaining
    access to the chief executive’s e-mail account could have devastating results.
    Therefore, the chief executive’s training might be more technically focused (i.e.
    remote attack, e-mail attack vectors). The risk exponentially increases where
    a third party is involved, as it makes it easier to impersonate staff members
    they have never met. A third party’s training would focus on how attackers may
    attempt to circumvent the current procedures for resetting passwords. However,
    this is not to say that a business shouldn’t take receptionists through spear
    phishing attacks, nor chief executives and help desk technicians through the dangers
    of tailgating. It is simply that the more focused and targeted the training program
    is, the more likely it is to succeed in achieving its aims.

    methodologies are beyond the scope of this book, however, it is important to understand
    their significant role in creating effective awareness and training material.
    The risks to an individual department will vary greatly from one department to
    another. The finance department may consider loss of integrity with their database
    as the greatest risk. Whereas the human resources department may deem the loss
    of confidentiality in staff records as their greatest risk. These general risks
    are important and they will inevitably be included in the foundational awareness
    and training. However, these are general departmental risks whereas, from a social
    engineering perspective, there may be additional concerns. For example, in terms
    of social engineering attacks, the IT department faces the risk of being impersonated
    for their privileges. The sales department may be at risk of remote telephone
    attacks aimed at leveraging their desire to make sales. The salesman may be sent
    an e-mail with a promising lead only a click away. These types of social engineering
    risks may not be immediately obvious to each department, especially if they have
    had no prior experience with social engineering. It is also important to establish
    who will be responsible for the risk assessment process. Will the management take
    responsibility for the process or will a third party be hired? Both general and
    social engineering risks should be identified and used as the basis for the departmentally
    specific training sections of the program.

    executed, they will be able to detect when such an attack is being attempted in
    different contexts. For example, spotting general phishing e-mails is relatively
    easy, often due to their poor use of English and adherence to common themes such
    as lockedout bank accounts or a one-time only money-making scheme. However, spotting
    spear phishing e-mails is not so easy, especially if they are highly targeted

    a specific door code, maybe they are the only person with access to the CCTV system.
    Whatever their specific privilege, they could be targeted because of it. Training
    of this type would be delivered through custom computer-based learning, web-based
    assessments, or perhaps through individual one-to-one training from a professional
    security consultant. The important part of this section of the program is identifying
    those individuals in the first place. The obvious examples would be chief executives
    and members of upper management. However, if a cleaner has a key to open any door
    in the building, then they may well be a primary target. Another example might
    be with physical media backups to an off-site location. As a consequence, the
    individual (or third party) assigned responsibility for moving the media from
    one location to another may then become a high value target.

    may decide to explore the risk associated with long game attack strategies. It

    unlikely risks need to be mitigated. Professional social engineers could be hired
    to explore social engineering techniques that span over months. The consultants
    may be hired to target specific individuals or design elaborate scenarios involving
    multiple blended attack vectors. The results of assessments of this type would

    sessions to establish if the program is actually being implemented correctly.
    If staff are away or not attending the training sessions, then weak points in
    the security will be created. However, tracking its progress is quite different
    from tracking its effectiveness. Often a program’s effectiveness is determined
    by the results of surveys, interviews, questionnaires and formal reports. These
    may well provide some insight into whether the awareness and training material
    has increased the overall security. However, the only way to really know how effective
    the program is, would be to test it practically.

    and training program through multiple choice tests or similar paper-based activity.
    This type of test may be suitable for general foundational awareness material
    but would be unlikely to determine the level of an individual’s insight into social
    engineering attacks. This can only really be achieved through internal assessments,
    assessment-based workshop activities, or even one-to-one discussions.

- en: Internal social engineering assessments, as discussed in [Chapter 16](CHP016.xhtml),
    are the best way to test the program’s effectiveness practically. Internal assessments
    of this kind can be highly controlled and very specific to individual aspects
    of security such as a single procedure or maybe even a particular staff member,
    though ethical considerations would obviously apply in this case. Every aspect
    of the social engineering awareness program should be regularly tested, whether
    it be an internal test or via a professional third-party company. It is from the
    results of these tests that the current material can be improved and new material
    created. The awareness and training program should be constantly growing and evolving
    alongside the business.

- en: General awareness and training programs have their flaws, especially in regard
    to social engineering. The lack of actual hands-on training leaves staff hopelessly
    ill equipped to detect attacks, and even less so to prevent them. While security
    experts debate over whether or not awareness training should even be performed,
    social engineering training is pushed further and further to the back burner.
    The worrying issue here is that awareness and training programs are a truly critical
    part of a company’s defense against social engineering type attacks. There is
    only so much that technology, hardened policies and hardened procedures can achieve.
    If businesses are to effectively defend themselves from social engineering, they
    need to properly train the individuals that are being targeted. However, it is
    important to ensure that the program is properly designed, tested and regularly
    improved, so as not to have weaknesses that could be leveraged by attackers.

- en: A general model of creating awareness and training programs has been presented,
    with each section discussed in relation to aspects of social engineering. During
    the initial stages of planning and design, the importance of management “buy-in”
    and keeping the program aligned with the business’s mission are vital first steps.
    The individual departments can then spearhead the creation of tailored training
    material, ensuring that the right assets are identified and the most significant
    risks addressed.

    knowledge and skills they need to help prevent attacks. Training such as workshops
    and role-play activities encourage users to explore the various security issues,
    gaining a real insight into the attacks and how best to defend against them.

    systematically and its progress and performance monitored. Regular testing should
    occur to ensure that the program is achieving its objectives. Any failings should
    be quickly identified and used to further improve the program, using outside assistance
    from professional social engineers where necessary.
