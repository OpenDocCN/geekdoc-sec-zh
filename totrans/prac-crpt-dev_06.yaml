- en: In cryptography the **randomness** (entropy) plays very important role. In many
    algorithms, we need **random (i.e. unpredictable) numbers**. If these numbers
    are not unpredictable, the algorithms will be compromised.

    assets. This secret key should be **randomly generated** in a way that nobody
    else should be able to generate or have the same key. If we generate the key from
    a **secure random generator**, the it will be **unpredictable** and the system
    will be secure. Therefore "secure random" means simply "**unpredictable random**".

    their role in **cryptography**, as well as pseudo-random numbers generators (**PRNG**),
    secure pseudo-random generators (**CSPRNG**) and some guidelines about how developers
    should generate and use random numbers in their code.

- en: In computer science **random numbers** usually come from a **pseudo-random number
    generators** (PRNG), initialized by some unpredictable initial randomness (**entropy**).
    In cryptography secure PRNGs are used, known as **CSPRNG**, which typically combined
    entropy with PRNG and other techniques to make the generated randomness **unpredictable**.

- en: A pseudorandom number generator (**PRNG**) is used to stretch a small amount
    of **initial randomness** into a large amount of **pseudorandomness**, typically
    for use in cryptosystems. Note than **PRNGs** are not cryptographically secure
    and are different from **CSPRNGs**.

- en: '**PRNGs** are functions that start from some **initial entropy** (seed) and
    calculate the next random number by some calculation which is unpredictable without
    knowing the seed. Such calculations are called **pseudo-random functions**.'

- en: Pseudo-random functions (which are not secure for cryptography) usually use
    an internal **state**. At the start, the state is initialized by an **initial
    seed**. When the **next random number** is generated, it is calculated from the
    internal state (using some computation or formula), then the internal **state**
    of the pseudo-random function is changed (using some computation or formula).
    When the **next random number** is generated, it is again calculated based on
    the internal **state** of the function and this state is again changed and so
    on.
