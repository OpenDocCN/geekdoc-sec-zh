    chapter walks through an assessment step by step to take the mystery out of the
    process. Various tools and techniques are discussed, enabling the reader to select
    the best tool and approach for their organization. Although tools and techniques
    are a large part of the process, other elements must be coordinated to perform
    a successful assessment. This chapter also discusses the planning and coordination
    elements of a simulated phishing assessment.

- en: Simulated phishing attacks are gaining popularity within organizations for many
    reasons. When implemented properly, simulated phishing attacks can be utilized
    as training tools, test resistance to attacks, and provide metrics to management.
    While simulated phishing attacks are useful, they can also be a bit intimidating
    if you haven't created one before. In this chapter we'll go through the process
    step by step and discuss some tools to help along the way. Beginning a simulated
    phishing campaign can be overwhelming at first. Keep in mind that you aren't testing
    everyone in your organization at once. These campaigns, or assessments, can easily
    be divided into small groups.

- en: Phishing e-mails prey on a variety of human emotions in order to achieve the
    desired action [[1](#bb0010)]. Often, phishing e-mails create a sense of urgency,
    claiming that the recipient's account will be disabled if immediate action isn't
    taken. Another popular attack is the e-card e-mail. This attack indicates that
    someone has sent the user an e-card and they must click on the link to retrieve
    it. Other tactics to persuade an employee to fall prey to an attack include using
    their first name or sending an e-mail that appears to be from a fellow employee.

    and licensed with a license in which the copyright holder provides the rights
    to study, change and distribute the software to anyone and for any purpose.” In
    short, it's pretty much free. With this, there is most often no guarantee of the
    software and the effects it will have on your environment. Additionally, support
    is often limited to software/developer/user forums and limited e-mail responses.
    While this may seem scary reading the text alone, the majority of penetration
    testers, vulnerability analysts, and other technical staff in the cyber community
    use one or several open-source tools to get their job done. Of all the capabilities
    that these technical staff need, most of them are not made by for-profit companies,
    hence the reason to rely on the open-source community.

    mistaking a phishing exercise for a real attack. Your Chief Information Security
    Officer (CISO) must be aware of all planned and active exercises. The manager/handler
    of the company's incident response team (IRT) should be informed of all exercises
    prior to execution. The manager may choose to inform their team in order to prevent
    spending time and resources investing an exercise. The manager may also choose
    to not inform their team in order to evaluate their response to the attack(s).

    as the attack data/vectors could be passed on to prevent breaches elsewhere in
    the industry. Final authority, unless otherwise explicitly required by law, regulation,
    or policy, is usually give by the company's CEO and/or board members, in collaboration

    manager should be notified prior the phishing exercise. This management level

    assessment. Ideally, the e-mails should be sent when employees are likely to be
    at their desks midmorning or midafternoon. Also, keep in mind what time zone your
    recipients are in when scheduling e-mail delivery.

    be on vacation during the assessment, be sure to involve their backup contact
    person prior to sending any e-mails. Additionally, the personnel responsible for
    sending the e-mails and tracking their progress need to be available for questions.
    Don't start an exercise and be out of the office the next day.

    reporting after additional assessments. SET does not store result information,
    so record will need to be tracked separately, most likely in a spreadsheet. Comparison
    reporting is key when reporting results to management and other involved parties
