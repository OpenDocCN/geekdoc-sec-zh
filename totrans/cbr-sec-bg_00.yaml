    to write the word ‘cybersecurity’. Is it one word or two?  In the US, the Department
    of Homeland Security (DHS), the National Institute of Standards and Technology
    (NIST) and ISACA (the Information Security Audit and Control Association) use
    the one word version.  So does this book.  In the UK, they continue to split the
    term into two words: cyber security.'

- en: After attending multiple information security and cybersecurity conferences
    each year, often as a speaker, I began to realize in discussions with literally
    hundreds of professionals just how little concise and reliable information was
    available in the public domain.  As information and cybersecurity professionals
    constantly try to keep up with what the latest threats are and with how to effectively
    measure, manage and monitor them, the books and other resources they create tend
    to be geared toward other IT (information technology) professionals.

    and are critical to most people at an individual level, I realized that almost
    everybody would like to better understand this subject area.  Since cybersecurity
    now affects everyone, I saw a need for basic information that non-technical people
    would find accessible.

    in all types of enterprises.  If you are only looking for guidance on how to cover
    personal cybersecurity – try my other publication “How to Keep Stuff Safe Online”.

- en: My aim was to create something less technical and more informative than other
    available texts, providing an easy insight into how we got to need cybersecurity,
    what the implications are and how effective methods of controlling and mitigating
    the associated problems work.

- en: This book is thus designed to be a one-stop essential text for anybody who wants
    to get a broad, rapid and holistic view of the subject area.  You do not need
    any previous technical knowledge to understand the text.  Whenever a technical
    term is used, you will usually find a plain, non-technical English definition
    right below its first usage (otherwise – you can always look the term up in the
    back of the book).

    was not until 2009 that I began to need to specifically review and audit cybersecurity. 
    I was lucky to be sponsored by one of the largest companies in the world to look
    into both their internal controls and those required for their most significant
    suppliers.

- en: One of my early assignments was to prepare a white paper on the capabilities
    and limitations of Amazon Web Services, Salesforce and other Internet-based platforms. 
    The importance of the sponsoring company and subject matter provided me with access
    to some of the best cybersecurity minds on the planet and to a rapid and early
    appreciation of cyber risks and how to mitigate them.

    first version of a synchronized set of governance controls that would satisfy
    all their major global security, privacy and compliance requirements.  That required
    reviewing, organizing, deconstructing and reconstructing over 9,000 controls. 
    The finished library was less than 5% of the size of the original (just under
    400 controls) but still met every single relevant requirement.
  prefs: []

    of operational environments, gave me a deep understanding of the known cybersecurity
    risks and how to mitigate or eliminate them.

    requires a specific cybersecurity policy document.  Nobody had a document like
    this a few years ago.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The purpose of a cybersecurity policy document is to demonstrate that all appropriate
    risk and control factors relating to technology have been sufficiently considered. 
    In 2012, to my surprise, when I looked back at the governance controls from 2009,
    almost every component needed for a cybersecurity policy was already present. 
    Pretty much the only missing detail was the need to pull together an overarching
    document to prove that all these components were present.  In 2017, a three-year-old
    governance policy would be badly outdated.  Evolving threats now regularly result
    in new and additional security requirements.

    the same, the sophistication of attacks is driving a substantial expansion of
    the security controls available to protect, detect, block, investigate and recover
    from attempts at unauthorized access.

- en: We are still at the dawn of cybersecurity.  There are plenty of poorly defended
    organizations (and individuals) that continue to be compromised by more knowledgeable
    adversaries.  The speed at which technology is now evolving is going to make that
    situation worse rather than better.  Established companies can easily fall behind
    if they are unable to safely leverage new technologies. Conversely, more companies
    you never heard of until recently take their place in the Fortune 500, FTSE 100
    and other listings because they are tech-savvy and focus on safely and more rapidly
    leveraging and implementing new technologies.

- en: There are also a really large number of cybersecurity jobs on offer around the
    world – in 2016 experts estimated that about one million such jobs remained unfilled. 
    Nearly all of the organizations that need cybersecurity professionals are struggling
    to find suitable candidates.  The fact is that very few people were working specifically
    in this sector until about 2013, and the number of qualified professionals has
    not yet caught up with the demand.

    at least 10 years cybersecurity experience,’ it makes cybersecurity people chuckle. 
    That level of experience rarely exists and is nearly irrelevant when it does. 
    We also do not apply for such jobs unless we are ‘fond of a treat’ (a British
    expression of irony suggesting the person enjoys inviting pain and suffering on
    him or herself).  Who wants to take on the challenge of working for an enterprise
    that lacks even a basic understanding of the modern cybersecurity industry?  Nobody
    wants to be employed only as a scapegoat.

- en: During the next few years, we will regularly (almost daily at present) see some
    truly spectacular stories hit the mainstream press about the next organization
    that got caught with gaps in their cybersecurity defenses. Since I wrote the first
    edition of this book, these breaches have included millions of personal details
    stolen from the US Office of Personnel Management and a billion account details
    from Yahoo.  So how is this happening?
  prefs: []

- en: It is happening because, like anything new, we are not yet mature and stable
    at using our digital devices.  If you imagine how things were in the early days
    of the car, there was no clear idea about where to locate the steering wheel,
    so it started out being in the center of the car on many models.  There were no
    seatbelts, roll cages or airbags.  People were just amazed that the car moved
    without a horse strapped to the front, so they started out calling it ‘The Horseless
    Carriage.’
  prefs: []

- en: The current digital era is very much like those early days of the car.  It is
    the wild west of technology out there right now.  A new gold rush.  Companies
    are often unknowingly staking everything on each new technology they connect to
    their digital ecosystem.

    is often a risk-based gamble.  This book will help you to better understand those
    risks and how to control them.  Use the right new technologies quickly and you
    can benefit greatly.  Spend time and money on verifying technology and its security
    before you use it and you will be safer, but you could fall behind your competition.
