  zh: 这是本书的第二版。 虽然网络安全问题不断增加，但关于网络安全的入门书籍仍然非常少。 原因很简单：

- en: 'As I prepare the second edition, there is still no global consensus on how
    to write the word ‘cybersecurity’. Is it one word or two?  In the US, the Department
    of Homeland Security (DHS), the National Institute of Standards and Technology
    (NIST) and ISACA (the Information Security Audit and Control Association) use
    the one word version.  So does this book.  In the UK, they continue to split the
    term into two words: cyber security.'

  zh: 当我准备第二版时，全球仍然没有就如何书写“网络安全”一词达成共识。它是一个词还是两个词？在美国，国土安全部（DHS）、国家标准与技术研究所（NIST）和ISACA（信息安全审计与控制协会）使用单个词版本。
    这本书也是如此。在英国，他们仍然将该术语分成两个词：网络安全。
- en: After attending multiple information security and cybersecurity conferences
    each year, often as a speaker, I began to realize in discussions with literally
    hundreds of professionals just how little concise and reliable information was
    available in the public domain.  As information and cybersecurity professionals
    constantly try to keep up with what the latest threats are and with how to effectively
    measure, manage and monitor them, the books and other resources they create tend
    to be geared toward other IT (information technology) professionals.

  zh: 每年参加多次信息安全和网络安全会议，通常作为发言人，我开始意识到与成百上千的专业人士讨论时，公共领域中提供的简明可靠信息是多么少。 由于信息和网络安全专业人员不断努力跟上最新的威胁，以及如何有效地衡量、管理和监视它们，他们创建的书籍和其他资源往往面向其他信息技术（IT）专业人员。
- en: But now that technology and digital devices are a core part of any organization
    and are critical to most people at an individual level, I realized that almost
    everybody would like to better understand this subject area.  Since cybersecurity
    now affects everyone, I saw a need for basic information that non-technical people
    would find accessible.

  zh: 但是现在科技和数字设备已经成为任何组织的核心部分，并且对大多数人在个人层面至关重要，我意识到几乎每个人都希望更好地了解这个主题。 由于网络安全现在影响着每个人，我看到了对非技术人员易于理解的基础信息的需求。

    personal cybersecurity – try my other publication “How to Keep Stuff Safe Online”.

    to get a broad, rapid and holistic view of the subject area.  You do not need
    any previous technical knowledge to understand the text.  Whenever a technical
    term is used, you will usually find a plain, non-technical English definition
    right below its first usage (otherwise – you can always look the term up in the
    back of the book).

    was not until 2009 that I began to need to specifically review and audit cybersecurity. 
    I was lucky to be sponsored by one of the largest companies in the world to look
    into both their internal controls and those required for their most significant
    suppliers.

    and limitations of Amazon Web Services, Salesforce and other Internet-based platforms.

- en: At around the same time, a Fortune 50 company commissioned me to compile their
    first version of a synchronized set of governance controls that would satisfy
    all their major global security, privacy and compliance requirements.  That required
    reviewing, organizing, deconstructing and reconstructing over 9,000 controls. 
    The finished library was less than 5% of the size of the original (just under
    400 controls) but still met every single relevant requirement.

    risk and control factors relating to technology have been sufficiently considered. 
    In 2012, to my surprise, when I looked back at the governance controls from 2009,
    almost every component needed for a cybersecurity policy was already present. 
    Pretty much the only missing detail was the need to pull together an overarching
    document to prove that all these components were present.  In 2017, a three-year-old
    governance policy would be badly outdated.  Evolving threats now regularly result
    in new and additional security requirements.

- en: Although many of the primary methods of securing technologies have remained

    organizations (and individuals) that continue to be compromised by more knowledgeable
    adversaries.  The speed at which technology is now evolving is going to make that
    situation worse rather than better.  Established companies can easily fall behind
    if they are unable to safely leverage new technologies. Conversely, more companies
    you never heard of until recently take their place in the Fortune 500, FTSE 100

    at least 10 years cybersecurity experience,’ it makes cybersecurity people chuckle. 
    That level of experience rarely exists and is nearly irrelevant when it does. 
    We also do not apply for such jobs unless we are ‘fond of a treat’ (a British
    expression of irony suggesting the person enjoys inviting pain and suffering on

    at using our digital devices.  If you imagine how things were in the early days
