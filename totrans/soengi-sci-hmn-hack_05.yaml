    remember your pretext if you base it in reality—for you and for the target. By
    this, I mean you should try to use pieces of your real life and use knowledge
    you already have or can easily assimilate. I often tell people that I think one
    of the hardest relationships to fake is a father-daughter relationship. I didn't
    understand this relationship until I had my own daughter. The way I talk about
    her and the emotions I feel are near impossible to fake, I think. If I didn't
    have a daughter but needed to build rapport with a target who did, it would be
    dangerous to have a pretext that includes a fake daughter. But, I can have a niece,
    right?

    that you already possess or can easily fake. Going back to some of my proposed
    pretexts from the previous section, I know very little about elevators and their

    have led to my failure if I were to be quizzed.

    I handed them the “Get out of jail free” letter, as I like to call it. This letter
    is written by the client company to detail who I am, what I am doing, and that
    I have permission to do it. It also gives one or two contact numbers of people
    to back up my story.

    agreeable voice.

    Fortunately, in their haste, the guards left me with my cell phone and my lock
    picks. In a few minutes, I was out of the closet, had unlocked the office door,
    and was sitting in the hallway calling my point of contact to tell him to get
    this fixed *now*! And am I thankful I called him the night before to ensure he
    was going to be in. A few minutes later, this was all squared away, and I was
    leaving free and un-tased.

    people about the right things at the right time. I know this is vague, but that''s
    because the requirements and rules change per job, per task, and per client. Some
    clients require significantly more hand-holding than others. Just remember, you

    removes your ability to be dynamic. I guarantee you one thing: nothing will go
    exactly as planned. Having the ability to be dynamic gives you a leg up and a
    higher success ratio.  ## Summary'

    can better perfect them. Remember that each principle builds on the next principle
    and will help you become a stronger social engineer in the process.

    that keep the target in beta mode (refer to Dr. Langer's research in [Chapter
    1](c01.xhtml)). Using reality rather than all fiction will make it easier for
    you to stay in pretext and make it easier for the target to believe you. Having
    your pretext firmly based in reality helps you determine how far you should go
    for that particular job, so your effort is at the right level and not too much
    or too little. Keeping it simple also helps boost your memory retention for not
    only the facts of your pretext but also whatever information you obtain (so you
    can recall it easier). All this planning makes it easy to decide what outfits,
    gear, and tech you need to support your pretext. If you have made it this far,
    you can easily execute the pretext.

    imagine if you had gone with me to those warehouses, but you had shown up with
    a smart business suit and a briefcase. Does that fit the identity of a trash compactor
    repairman?

    in [Chapter 3](c03.xhtml): Who are you, what do you want, are you a threat, and
    how long will this take? But there is another purpose of those questions that
    needs to be addressed, which is the topic of [Chapter 5](c05.xhtml), and it has
    to do with building rapport.'
