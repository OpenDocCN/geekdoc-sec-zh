    remember your pretext if you base it in reality—for you and for the target. By

    you already have or can easily assimilate. I often tell people that I think one
    of the hardest relationships to fake is a father-daughter relationship. I didn't
    understand this relationship until I had my own daughter. The way I talk about
    her and the emotions I feel are near impossible to fake, I think. If I didn't
    have a daughter but needed to build rapport with a target who did, it would be
    dangerous to have a pretext that includes a fake daughter. But, I can have a niece,

  zh: 这个原则可以很容易地解释为，如果你的借口基于现实，对你和目标来说都更容易记住。我的意思是，你应该尽量利用你的真实生活中的片段，并利用你已经拥有或可以轻松吸收的知识。我经常告诉人们，我认为最难虚假的关系之一是父女关系。直到有了自己的女儿，我才明白这种关系。我谈论她的方式和我感受到的情感几乎是不可能伪造的，我认为。如果我没有女儿但需要与拥有女儿的目标建立关系，那么使用一个包括虚假女儿的借口是很危险的。但是，我可以有一个侄女，对吧？

- en: Planning your goals efficiently can help you come up with reality-based pretexts
    that keep the target in beta mode (refer to Dr. Langer's research in [Chapter
    1](c01.xhtml)). Using reality rather than all fiction will make it easier for
    you to stay in pretext and make it easier for the target to believe you. Having
    your pretext firmly based in reality helps you determine how far you should go
    for that particular job, so your effort is at the right level and not too much
    or too little. Keeping it simple also helps boost your memory retention for not
    only the facts of your pretext but also whatever information you obtain (so you
    can recall it easier). All this planning makes it easy to decide what outfits,
    gear, and tech you need to support your pretext. If you have made it this far,
    you can easily execute the pretext.

  zh: 有效规划你的目标可以帮助你提出基于现实的前提，让目标保持在测试模式（参考[第一章](c01.xhtml)中 Langer 博士的研究）。使用现实而不是全部虚构将使你更容易保持前提，并使目标更容易相信你。将你的前提牢固地基于现实有助于确定你为特定工作应该走多远，这样你的努力就处于正确的水平，不会太多或太少。保持简单也有助于增强你对前提事实以及你获得的任何信息的记忆力（这样你可以更容易地回忆起它）。所有这些计划使你更容易决定你需要什么服装、装备和技术来支持你的前提。如果你已经做到了这一步，你可以轻松地执行前提。
