    people in certain jobs and roles that they never themselves have done. Pretexting

    computers and try to get pictures of any papers or projects that were not public.'

    Reality vs. Fiction'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This principle can be easily defined by explaining how much easier it is to
    remember your pretext if you base it in reality—for you and for the target. By
    this, I mean you should try to use pieces of your real life and use knowledge
    you already have or can easily assimilate. I often tell people that I think one
    of the hardest relationships to fake is a father-daughter relationship. I didn't
    understand this relationship until I had my own daughter. The way I talk about
    her and the emotions I feel are near impossible to fake, I think. If I didn't
    have a daughter but needed to build rapport with a target who did, it would be
    dangerous to have a pretext that includes a fake daughter. But, I can have a niece,
    right?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: My point is that your pretext should be based on facts, emotions, and knowledge
    that you already possess or can easily fake. Going back to some of my proposed
    pretexts from the previous section, I know very little about elevators and their
    operation, so trying to fake my way as an elevator repairman would most likely
    have led to my failure if I were to be quizzed.

    that keep the target in beta mode (refer to Dr. Langer's research in [Chapter
    1](c01.xhtml)). Using reality rather than all fiction will make it easier for
    you to stay in pretext and make it easier for the target to believe you. Having
    your pretext firmly based in reality helps you determine how far you should go
    for that particular job, so your effort is at the right level and not too much
    or too little. Keeping it simple also helps boost your memory retention for not
    only the facts of your pretext but also whatever information you obtain (so you
    can recall it easier). All this planning makes it easy to decide what outfits,
    gear, and tech you need to support your pretext. If you have made it this far,
    you can easily execute the pretext.
