    convince the victim to give up valuable information, such as a password. The most
    common example of a pretexting attack is when someone calls an employee and pretends
    to be someone in power, such as the CEO or on the information technology team.
    The attacker convinces the victim that the scenario is true and collects information
    that is sought.

    scenario, which is the pretext used to engage the victim. The pretext sets the
    scene for the attack along with the characters and the plot. It is the foundation

    A pretext is composed of the following two main elements:'

    It is a sequence of believable events, designed and guided by the social engineer
    to extract information or manipulate the target. The chosen pretext is based on
    the initial reconnaissance. It is this reconnaissance that not only points to
    a viable pretext but also provides the necessary information to support it.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The plausible situation involves the social engineer playing a “role” much like
    an actor. This does not necessarily mean impersonating someone real, in fact,
    it is more often a fictitious character. However, it is important to remember
    that there are many aspects to consider when creating a character. The social
    engineer must consider how they would dress, how they would speak and what kind
    of skill set they would have.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    from a member of the public. They have searched through the victim’s garbage and
    found a letter from their Internet service provider (ISP). They decide to use
    this information to their advantage and build a pretext around it. This attack
    would likely involve many different aspects but here we just concentrate on the
    basic pretext that could be used.

    the previous attempt to retrieve the necessary funds via direct debit has failed.
    If the customer is confident they have the sufficient funds, then the ISP would
    like to check it isn’t a mistake at their end. They would like to confirm the
    bank account number used, by the victim, and retry the transaction while they
    are on the phone. If the transaction is successful they will amend their records
    accordingly.

    posing as the engineer has turned up to site and needs access to the building
    to check each fire extinguisher and replace them where necessary. This is not

    foundation on which to build the attack. The other techniques described in this

    techniques to support the pretext to name just a few.

    impersonation. As previously mentioned, this impersonation need not be of a real
    individual, instead it will likely be a character specifically designed for the
    pretext. When designing a character for a pretext the following questions should
    be asked:'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you cannot answer any of these basic questions then your impersonation may
    fail. The reason for this is that any inconsistencies in the impersonation will
    likely draw attention and affect the overall pretext. If someone calls at the
    door claiming to be a policeman wearing a string vest and sandals, it is unlikely
    that they will be believed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Inconsistencies that draw attention can result in validation checks, which will
    put significant pressure on the robustness of the pretext (not to mention on the
    social engineer themselves). A validation check could be through asking for details
    of an onsite contact or to provide valid photo identification. Although such occurrences
    can be somewhat planned for, such as detailed cover stories and fake badges, they
    can easily lead to a full exposure of the attack. Therefore, it is critical that
    you don’t impersonate someone with a characteristic that you cannot replicate
    convincingly.
  prefs: []

    attract any unwanted attention. Some social engineers believe that it is not enough
    to just “play the role”, the social engineer has to actually “believe” they are
    that individual. However, it doesn’t really matter how much you believe you are
    another person, if the victim doesn’t believe you due to inconsistencies then
    your attack will be unlikely to succeed.

    individual’s privileges. When impersonating someone who actually exists, a few
    challenges present themselves.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The most obvious challenge is learning enough about the individual so as to
    answer the questions listed above. For example, it is significantly harder to
    profile an individual to this extent without employing long-term attack strategies,
    such as long-term surveillance. Clearly if you don’t look anything like the individual,
    then a face-to-face impersonation with someone that knows them is unlikely to
    succeed. The most common approach is to try and contact the individual, record
    them and practice imitating their voice. If this can be accomplished then an impersonation
    over the telephone may well be possible.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are situations where a real person can be impersonated without having
    to sound anything like them. For instance, in situations where the victim knows
    who the person is but has never met them. If you are attacking a large business
    with many employees, it is unlikely that everyone will have met everyone else.
    The social engineer could contact the reception impersonating a random new starter,
    one that the receptionist is unlikely to have met. In this situation the social
    engineer will probably sound nothing like that individual in any way. In a sense,
    the impersonation is very poor but it doesn’t need to be convincing. Simply by
    claiming that you are a certain someone, from a certain department, may be enough
    to gain the credibility you need.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Impersonating individuals via e-mail and written communication would seem like
    the safest option. However, written correspondence can just as easily contain
    inconsistencies that may be spotted. When attempting to impersonate an individual
    in this way, it is important to gather as many examples of their writing styles
    as possible. The individual may commonly use certain formalities, informalities,
    poor grammar or other particular traits. Including such traits like this could
    increase credibility, whereas not including them could raise suspicions.

    swindle money out of their mark. They present an enticing opportunity for the
    victim and use it to draw them into the scam. In many ways, this can be thought
    of as a simple bait and trap situation. As long as the target’s attention is on

    are devices such as Teensy which will essentially simulate keyboard input when
    attached, achieving the same back door objective. However, the same challenges
    discussed above may still apply. One solution is to ensure that only your intended
    target receives the device. Some professional penetration testers and social engineers
    have solved the problem by building the Teensy into computer mice, and then sending
    the mouse as a gift to the target.

    the form of a negative emotional state such as fear, anger, indignation or shame.
    Then to present the victim with a solution that would mitigate or remove the emotion.
    The solution would of course aid the attacker in achieving their own objective.
    This is similar to baiting as the victim is blinded by the emotion much like they
    are blinded by the bait. If you can invoke a strong enough emotion then that is
    all the victim will focus on.

    to perform the tasks set forth by management. The very nature of the employee
    hierarchal system means that employers can “manipulate” the employees, providing
    this demand aligns with the expectations of the job role. If the employee believes
    the social engineer to be part of management, they will likely conform to any
    reasonable request. Providing management with sensitive information would be unlikely
    to raise any alarms. In fact, information requests of this kind may well be fairly
    routine. For example, a social engineer (or private investigator) could contact
    the HR department of the target business posing as management, requesting information
    about a specific employee. Provided the HR department believed them to be management
    they’d likely release the information.

    security controls and also as a deterrent, they are of course security guards.
    Security guards can be very effective but, in terms of security, they are a double-edged
    sword. If a social engineer could impersonate one of them, which would likely
    require little more than a fake uniform, they could use the authority to great
    effect. The social engineer could ask to see an employee’s security badge, maybe
    even confiscate it. They could claim to be conducting some security checks and
    want to see the location of keys. In addition, the chances of an employee challenging
    and questioning a security guard are very slim indeed, even if they didn’t recognize

    the victim to seek assistance from the social engineer to solve a problem. The
    social engineer then provides the assistance, which also aids the attack. The

    way around. This is why it is called reverse social engineering.

    chances are that someone will have a problem, in fact it is almost guaranteed.
    The social engineer could then agree to help solve that problem. The challenging
    part is to work the attack into the solution. For example, the social engineer
    could claim that they require the user’s credentials to log in remotely. Or the
    social engineer could ask the user to browse to a particular website to test connectivity,

    multitude of different ways. The concept is to manufacture or orchestrate a situation
    where the victim “assumes” the social engineer has already been validated. To
    demonstrate this concept we will jump straight into a simple example.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The social engineer could send an e-mail to a business impersonating a specific
    customer, requesting information about the service they recently received. The
    information could be something that only the engineer that performed the service
    would know. The employee receiving the e-mail could then contact the engineer
    to retrieve that information and relay it back to the social engineer. The important
    part of this simple example is how the engineer perceived the situation. From
    the engineer’s perspective, a legitimate employee had requested information that
    isn’t restricted within the company. They have no reason to query the request
    and they “assume” that the original employee had validated the customer. Therefore,
    the social engineer gains the credibility of that legitimate employee and indirectly
    retrieves the information from the engineer. The authentication is passed down
    the chain gaining strength with each person.

    perhaps to cause disruption or access patient records. They approach reception
    posing as an air-conditioning repair engineer. The social engineer explains to
    one of the receptionists that “*I’m here to perform a maintenance check of the
    air conditioning units in the server room, the IT department sent me here as apparently
    you have keys*”. The receptionist replies “*Sorry we don’t have them, the only
    person with keys is the porter, his office is just down the hall.*”. The social
    engineers leave and then return a few minutes later saying “*Sorry but no one
    is answering at the door, I’ll try again a little later.*”. They could continue
    pretending to try the door and telling reception that they’re not answering, until
    the receptionist agrees to investigate herself. When the receptionist tries the
    door, the porter answers and the receptionist explains “*Ah you are in after all,
    this gentleman is here to do some stuff with the air conditioning in the server
    room, can you take him up there*”. The porter will then very likely assume that
    the receptionist has already validated the engineer, creating the chain of authentication.
    This particular example is actually an account of a real attack performed by the
    authors, demonstrating how effective this technique can be.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another way of using this technique is to impersonate the employee that makes
    the validation. For example, the social engineer could impersonate an employee
    and contact reception explaining that “*…an engineer from Vulnerable Inc is arriving
    in the next 20 minutes or so, can you ensure they sign in and give them a pass
    to get in and out please. They know what they’re doing and where they’re going.*”.
    Here the receptionist assumes that the visiting engineer has already been validated
    by the employee. The social engineer could then arrive posing as the engineer
    and gain access to the building. In this case, the social engineer forms the start
    and the end of the chain.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    piece of the chain to the victim. For example, the social engineer could contact
    the victim saying “*I’ve just been speaking with your manager Susan, she says
    that you might be able to help me…* ”. The victim may assume that their manager,
    Susan, has already validated the caller, when in fact they never spoke in the

    Stewart was away, perhaps from an out-of-office e-mail response. Consequently,

    picture. The initial reconnaissance stage performed before an attack could be
    viewed as collecting as many pieces of the puzzle as possible. However, this analogy
    can be taken a little further. Each piece of a jigsaw puzzle fits with at least
    one other piece, which can usually be confirmed with the image printed on the
    front. Therefore, each piece can be used to identify at least one other piece
    that fits. To a social engineer any piece of “innocuous” information is a piece
    of a jigsaw puzzle, one that could be used to identify another, possibly more
    significant piece of information. The social engineer tries to determine what
    other information can be obtained using what they currently have. Using innocuous
    information to identify and obtain sensitive information, then using sensitive
    information to obtain more sensitive information, is the ongoing process of a

    they could, that was associated with the word just said by their opponent. For
    example, one child may say “*Sun!*”, then the other may say “Moon!”. If either
    child was too slow to answer the other with an associated word, they received
    a foam mallet to the head, courtesy of Timmy himself. In this example, the individuals

    produce “*They caught the ball*” or something similar that made sense. One group
    of students was given sets of words that contained key words associated with the
    elderly, such as “*frail, forgetful, grey, balding, etc.*”. Once the students
    had finished this part of the experiment they were told to head to the next stage
    down the corridor. The researchers timed how long it took each student to walk
    to the next experiment. They found, as predicted, that the students primed with
    words associated with the elderly took significantly longer to reach the end of

    so this technique could be very useful indeed. However, the practical application
    of this in terms of breaching security comes with a few challenges. First, the
    effect on the individual is not so significant that they’d be willing to do something
    they know is wrong. Therefore, you couldn’t ever “prime” someone into letting
    you into a restricted area without a really good reason. However, you could potentially
    prime a victim into a specific state, such as being more “agreeable” for example,
    that may aid in achieving an objective. The second and most obvious challenge
    is how the prime is applied without the victim realizing. As we have discussed,
    the association can happen without the victim knowing, but the application of
    priming could be very obvious indeed in a real-world scenario. If a social engineer
    tried to put in key words such as “open”, “access”, and “granted” into casual
    conversation then the victim may end up more confused than primed. Priming should
    be thought of as a supporting technique, and should not form the basis of an attack.

    of equipment and personal items appear to have been stolen. The victim can hear
    the office alarm clearly in the background. The social engineer then explains
    “*The police are on their way so I’ll keep you posted, there’s no need for you

    it is possible to invoke trust in a person, just as you would invoke any emotion.
    A female social engineer displaying a pregnancy bump would certainly invoke a
    great deal of trust in those around her. Should the fake pregnancy bump contain
    tools such as lock-picks and drop boxes then you’d have a very dangerous social
    engineer indeed.

    their imagination. However, it should be noted that emotions are, by their very
    nature, unpredictable at best. A carefully planned exploitation of a strong emotion
    could easily turn into a tirade of uncontrollable events, resulting in a very
    difficult situation for the social engineer to manage.

- en: Selective attention is a fascinating phenomenon regarding how we process information.
    It is sometimes referred to as the “cocktail party effect”. The reader may have
    experienced this effect when in a crowded room, when they are able to single out
    and understand a single voice among the many others. We are able to almost filter
    out the unwanted sounds in the sense that we don’t process them, although we can
    still technically hear the noise. The only sound we process is the one we want
    to. In this example, the individual is purposefully filtering out the information.
    However, this effect can happen in many situations whether the individuals want
    it to happen or not. The simple reason for this is that our various senses receive
    far more information than we could ever hope to fully process. Therefore, the
    vast majority is buffered and our minds filter this information so that only the
    most important pieces get through. Attempts have been made to fully understand
    the details of this process such as the Broadbent, Treisman, Deutsch & Deutsch
    and Kahneman models for selective attention. A full discussion of these models
    is far beyond the scope of this book. However, the possibility of exploiting this
    phenomenon to aid in social engineer is within scope.

    Simons and Chabris. The video shows individuals, some dressed in black, others
    in white, passing basket balls to each other. The viewer is asked to count how
    many times the individuals dressed in white pass the basket ball. Approximately
    half way through the video a person in a gorilla costume walks to the center of
    the activity, waves at the camera and walks off the screen. At the end of the
    video the viewer is asked how many passes they counted. The vast majority of viewers
    do not notice the gorilla. I myself did not see it when watching this video for
    the first time and even had to watch it again from the beginning just to prove
    it was indeed there. The viewer’s attention is so transfixed on the complicated
    passing that they do not process the clearly obvious event of a gorilla waving
    right at them.

    of events that prevents the victim from processing certain information. Preventing
    victims from seeing the waving gorilla is obviously not that beneficial to a social
    engineer, however, the basic premise could be replicated to aid in an attack.
    All that social engineer needs to do is ensure the victim’s attention is focused
    on something complicated enough to prevent any other information from being processed.
    The “anything else” would of course be the element that achieves the objective.

- en: Personality typing has been around since ancient times and there have been many
    different models over the centuries. The various theories surrounding personality
    typing could fill many volumes. The idea of placing individuals into specific
    groups and then using those groups to predict their behavior has the potential
    for incredible applications. If you can accurately and consistently predict your
    own actions based on your own personality type, then you can use that knowledge
    to maximize your strengths and reduce your weaknesses. You could determine which
    people would be best assigned to certain tasks, build teams that cooperate effectively
    and gain great insight into disputes.

    on the target’s personality type to maximize the chances of affecting their decisions.
    This all sounds fantastic but unfortunately, as with many areas concerning human
    nature, personality typing is far from an exact science. You can certainly place
    individuals into personality type groups and even predict their actions with a
    pretty good degree of accuracy, but it is far from having a guaranteed outcome.
    The problem is that personality can change over time and no one really knows how
    personality is affected by influences such as genetics, upbringing, personal experiences
    and culture.

    challenges. Personalities shift and change by the moment based on circumstance
    and individuals may have a personality that spans multiple “distinct” groups depending
    on the model used to interpret it. The authors believe that influencing by personality
    type is not entirely practical in “short game” based real-world social engineering
    assessments. We fully expect many professional social engineers to react strongly
    to this statement claiming that they’ve consistently had great success. However,
    the authors stand by the belief that it should never form the basis for an attack,
    unless you have enough reconnaissance time and/or interaction with a target to
    be confident that a certain personality type-based approach would be effective.

    personality group and therefore responded more significantly to “authority” is
    not particularly valuable to a client. There are likely more pressing vulnerabilities
    concerning procedures, policies and awareness training that need to be identified
    and reported on first. However, that being said, there would be value in conducting
    awareness training based on how a social engineer may “attempt” to leverage certain
    personality types. Training workshops on the strengths and weaknesses of certain
    personality types could be quite beneficial to employees. The point here is not
    to make personality type issues a priority or even a focus until the more concrete

    much has already been written on how to influence each specific type. However,
    in an attempt to keep the content of this book as “practical” as possible, we
    will only discuss the supporting technique that we as professional security consultants
    have regularly used during assessments. As a supporting technique, influencing
    based on personality types can increase the chances of success of certain social
    engineering scenarios. Generally speaking, a proof of concept is all that is required
    in each scenario, so one success is sufficient. Nevertheless, occasionally a greater
    degree of success can add a “worst-case scenario” element, which the client may
    find useful (as leverage to release security budget for example).

- en: The personality type model we regularly use is Jung’s theory of the “introvert”
    and the “extrovert.” This theory places everyone into two distinct categories
    with opposing behaviors. The introvert finds their internal reality to be more
    real and are generally motivated by subjective matters. Individuals within this
    category are described as being introverted, which is synonymous with being quiet,
    thoughtful and reserved. The extrovert finds external reality to be more real;
    they usually define their existence based on their relationship with other people.
    Extroverts are often described as being extroverted, which usually means confident,
    chatty and outgoing.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The reason we use this model in social engineering engagements is for two main
    reasons. First, it is relatively easy to determine which group an individual belongs
    to. Introverts tend to be quiet, shy and inward thinking, while extroverts are
    the complete opposite, and although this is certainly not always the case, it
    is consistent enough to have a practical application. Second, influencing each
    group is straightforward, based solely on the absolute basics of the theory. For
    example, as extroverts define their existence based on their relationships with
    others, then logically they will be more susceptible to techniques such as social
    proof. As introverts tend to be more subjective, placing ideas in terms of how
    it affects them personally would be more effective.

    extroverts with extroverts. Consequently, in terms of establishing good rapport
    with someone who is clearly an introvert, storming in with a big personality may
    not be entirely effective. Good rapport can have a significant effect on decisions
    made by the target, so mirroring their group can be very effective indeed.

    state that this is because we look for a partner that would compliment our personality,
    opposites attract for example. Based on this, an outgoing and friendly female
    may be more effective at influencing an introvert male and vice versa.

    words. A much larger proportion is based on the pitch, speed and tone of the words.
    An even larger proportion still is based upon body language. To demonstrate this,
    imagine you have been summoned to your boss’s office for a dressing down. Your
    boss is stood with his hands on his hips towering over you, his face shows a look
    of general disdain. Their voice is booming as they describe how you’ve failed
    to meet their expectations in a recent project. Everything about this situation
    is unpleasant and communication is very clear; you’ve messed up in a big way.
    Now, suppose your boss is saying the exact same words, in the same booming voice,
    but this time is cowering in the corner of the room, sat with hands around his
    knees. This would be very odd indeed and you would likely not know what to make
    of it. Chances are you wouldn’t feel half as threatened and the words would lose
    all meaning. The body language takes precedence over the voice and words. Similarly,
    if your boss was to describe your failure to meet expectations in a squeaky mouse
    like voice, they probably wouldn’t have much impact at all.

    short in stature, they may use creative ways of overcoming these barriers. Such
    as the 5 ft 2 Regimental Sergeant Major (RSM), who has the most feared rank in
    the British Army, may place his desk on a raised plinth so that when subordinates
    are called in for disciplinary matters they will always be in a lower, subservient,

    support social engineering attacks. There are two ways in which body language
    techniques can be applied. The first way is to adjust your own body language to
    affect the target. An example of this would be using confident and dominating
    body language to support the impersonation of a chief executive. The other way
    is to “read” the body language of the target and adjust your approach accordingly.

    better to someone that is smiling. While this is generally true it is important
    to understand the difference between a real and a fake smile. A real smile can
    be seen in the eyes as the cheeks, sides of the eyes and eyebrows all raise up.
    A real smile is difficult to fake as the muscle movement involved tends to be
    subconscious. However, it is possible to fool a target into believing the smile
    is real and this can be extremely beneficial. If the target subconsciously picks
    up on an apparently genuine smile they will respond far more agreeably. Never

    to consider more than one element regarding an individual’s position concerning
    their arms and legs. For example, if someone has their arms and legs crossed and
    they’re sitting sideways on to you, then you can be pretty sure they’re not exactly
    engaged with you or what you’re saying. Whereas is they’re leaning across toward
    you with arms open they’re probably quite interested. Consequently, if the target
