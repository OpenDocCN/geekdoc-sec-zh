- en: The plausible situation involves the social engineer playing a “role” much like
    an actor. This does not necessarily mean impersonating someone real, in fact,
    it is more often a fictitious character. However, it is important to remember
    that there are many aspects to consider when creating a character. The social
    engineer must consider how they would dress, how they would speak and what kind
    of skill set they would have.

  zh: 可能的情况涉及社会工程师扮演“角色”，就像一个演员一样。这并不一定意味着冒充某个真实的人，事实上，更常见的是虚构的角色。然而，重要的是要记住，在创建角色时有许多方面需要考虑。社会工程师必须考虑他们会如何穿着、如何说话以及他们会具备什么样的技能。
- en: For example, suppose the social engineer would like to elicit bank account information
    from a member of the public. They have searched through the victim’s garbage and
    found a letter from their Internet service provider (ISP). They decide to use
    this information to their advantage and build a pretext around it. This attack

    the previous attempt to retrieve the necessary funds via direct debit has failed.
    If the customer is confident they have the sufficient funds, then the ISP would
    like to check it isn’t a mistake at their end. They would like to confirm the

- en: If you cannot answer any of these basic questions then your impersonation may
    fail. The reason for this is that any inconsistencies in the impersonation will
    likely draw attention and affect the overall pretext. If someone calls at the
    door claiming to be a policeman wearing a string vest and sandals, it is unlikely
    that they will be believed.

- en: Inconsistencies that draw attention can result in validation checks, which will
    put significant pressure on the robustness of the pretext (not to mention on the
    social engineer themselves). A validation check could be through asking for details
    of an onsite contact or to provide valid photo identification. Although such occurrences
    can be somewhat planned for, such as detailed cover stories and fake badges, they
    can easily lead to a full exposure of the attack. Therefore, it is critical that
    you don’t impersonate someone with a characteristic that you cannot replicate
    convincingly.

  zh: 引起注意的不一致可能导致验证检查，这将对前文的稳健性（以及社会工程师自己）施加重大压力。验证检查可能是通过要求提供现场联系人的详细信息或提供有效的照片身份证明来进行的。虽然此类事件可以在一定程度上进行计划，例如详细的掩护故事和假徽章，但它们很容易导致攻击的完全暴露。因此，重要的是不要冒充具有你无法令人信服地复制的特征的人。
- en: The aim is to make the impersonation so convincing and so “mundane” as to not
    attract any unwanted attention. Some social engineers believe that it is not enough
    to just “play the role”, the social engineer has to actually “believe” they are
    that individual. However, it doesn’t really matter how much you believe you are
    another person, if the victim doesn’t believe you due to inconsistencies then
    your attack will be unlikely to succeed.

    answer the questions listed above. For example, it is significantly harder to
    profile an individual to this extent without employing long-term attack strategies,
    such as long-term surveillance. Clearly if you don’t look anything like the individual,
    then a face-to-face impersonation with someone that knows them is unlikely to
    succeed. The most common approach is to try and contact the individual, record
    them and practice imitating their voice. If this can be accomplished then an impersonation
    over the telephone may well be possible.

  zh: 最明显的挑战是要充分了解个人，以便回答上述问题。例如，要在不采用长期攻击策略（如长期监视）的情况下对个人进行这种程度的剖析显然更加困难。显然，如果你和个人看起来一点也不像，那么与认识他们的人进行面对面的冒名顶替是不太可能成功的。最常见的方法是尝试联系个人，录制他们的声音并练习模仿他们的声音。如果能做到这一点，那么通过电话进行冒名顶替很可能是可能的。
- en: There are situations where a real person can be impersonated without having
    to sound anything like them. For instance, in situations where the victim knows
    who the person is but has never met them. If you are attacking a large business
    with many employees, it is unlikely that everyone will have met everyone else.
    The social engineer could contact the reception impersonating a random new starter,
    one that the receptionist is unlikely to have met. In this situation the social
    engineer will probably sound nothing like that individual in any way. In a sense,
    the impersonation is very poor but it doesn’t need to be convincing. Simply by
    claiming that you are a certain someone, from a certain department, may be enough
    to gain the credibility you need.

    the safest option. However, written correspondence can just as easily contain
    inconsistencies that may be spotted. When attempting to impersonate an individual
    in this way, it is important to gather as many examples of their writing styles
    as possible. The individual may commonly use certain formalities, informalities,
    poor grammar or other particular traits. Including such traits like this could

    would know. The employee receiving the e-mail could then contact the engineer
    to retrieve that information and relay it back to the social engineer. The important
    part of this simple example is how the engineer perceived the situation. From
    the engineer’s perspective, a legitimate employee had requested information that
    isn’t restricted within the company. They have no reason to query the request
    and they “assume” that the original employee had validated the customer. Therefore,
    the social engineer gains the credibility of that legitimate employee and indirectly
    retrieves the information from the engineer. The authentication is passed down

    person with keys is the porter, his office is just down the hall.*”. The social
    engineers leave and then return a few minutes later saying “*Sorry but no one
    is answering at the door, I’ll try again a little later.*”. They could continue
    pretending to try the door and telling reception that they’re not answering, until
    the receptionist agrees to investigate herself. When the receptionist tries the
    door, the porter answers and the receptionist explains “*Ah you are in after all,
    this gentleman is here to do some stuff with the air conditioning in the server
    room, can you take him up there*”. The porter will then very likely assume that
    the receptionist has already validated the engineer, creating the chain of authentication.

    using the right business lingo can also be very effective. Perhaps the employees
    regularly refer to the RSA 2-factor authentication token devices as RSA fobs for
    example. An attacker could use this to their advantage in a request to the IT
    department such as “*Hi James, it’s Simon from marketing, is Stewart there? Ah
    well, maybe you can help. I’m just onsite with our xyz client, I need to log in
    remotely but I forgot my RSA fob again, could I possibly use yours? Can you* *read
    out what it says?*”. In this situation the social engineer would have known that
    Stewart was away, perhaps from an out-of-office e-mail response. Consequently,
    in this example the names James, Simon, and Stewart all gain credibility, along
    with the name of the client and the RSA fob lingo.

    certain degree. Previous chapters have described information as being like pieces
    of a jigsaw puzzle, the more pieces you have the better you understand the big
    picture. The initial reconnaissance stage performed before an attack could be
    viewed as collecting as many pieces of the puzzle as possible. However, this analogy
    can be taken a little further. Each piece of a jigsaw puzzle fits with at least
    one other piece, which can usually be confirmed with the image printed on the
    front. Therefore, each piece can be used to identify at least one other piece
    that fits. To a social engineer any piece of “innocuous” information is a piece
    of a jigsaw puzzle, one that could be used to identify another, possibly more
    significant piece of information. The social engineer tries to determine what
    other information can be obtained using what they currently have. Using innocuous
    information to identify and obtain sensitive information, then using sensitive
    information to obtain more sensitive information, is the ongoing process of a
    social engineering attack.

    to the next experiment. They found, as predicted, that the students primed with
    words associated with the elderly took significantly longer to reach the end of

- en: Manipulating an individual’s actions is at the heart of social engineering,
    so this technique could be very useful indeed. However, the practical application
    of this in terms of breaching security comes with a few challenges. First, the
    effect on the individual is not so significant that they’d be willing to do something
    they know is wrong. Therefore, you couldn’t ever “prime” someone into letting
    you into a restricted area without a really good reason. However, you could potentially
    prime a victim into a specific state, such as being more “agreeable” for example,
    that may aid in achieving an objective. The second and most obvious challenge
    is how the prime is applied without the victim realizing. As we have discussed,
    the association can happen without the victim knowing, but the application of
    priming could be very obvious indeed in a real-world scenario. If a social engineer
    tried to put in key words such as “open”, “access”, and “granted” into casual
    conversation then the victim may end up more confused than primed. Priming should
    be thought of as a supporting technique, and should not form the basis of an attack.

    “访问”, 和“授权”等关键词，那么受害者可能会变得更困惑而不是被启动。启动应该被视为一种支持技术，并不应成为攻击的基础。

    but it is not the only way in which strong emotions can be leveraged. Arguably,
    any emotion could potentially aid an attack, depending on what the objective was.

    engineer to affect the victim, or whether it will be invoked in the victim themselves.
    For example, it is far more useful to invoke pity in the victim than show pity
    yourself. A victim that pities you will be more likely to help in any way they
    can, which could easily be leveraged in an attack. Invoking this emotion could
    take little more than claiming you’ve forgotten something important, walking with
    crutches or just playing the fool. However, be careful that your attempts to invoke
    pity doesn’t end up invoking contempt.

    All that may be required is to set off the fire alarm or call in the bomb scare
    and the employees will be very distracted. Another example would be for a social
    engineer to contact an employee at their home explaining that someone has broken
    into the office. They explain that there is broken glass everywhere and a lot
    of equipment and personal items appear to have been stolen. The victim can hear
    the office alarm clearly in the background. The social engineer then explains
    “*The police are on their way so I’ll keep you posted, there’s no need for you
    to come down. I’ve tried to disable the alarm but it’s not working, what code
    do you normally use*?”. The fear keeps the victim distracted and less likely to
    question anything about the situation.

    that trust is not an emotion but rather a perception of another person. However,
    it is possible to invoke trust in a person, just as you would invoke any emotion.
    A female social engineer displaying a pregnancy bump would certainly invoke a
    great deal of trust in those around her. Should the fake pregnancy bump contain
    tools such as lock-picks and drop boxes then you’d have a very dangerous social
    engineer indeed.

    their imagination. However, it should be noted that emotions are, by their very
    nature, unpredictable at best. A carefully planned exploitation of a strong emotion
    could easily turn into a tirade of uncontrollable events, resulting in a very
    difficult situation for the social engineer to manage.

- en: Selective attention is a fascinating phenomenon regarding how we process information.
    It is sometimes referred to as the “cocktail party effect”. The reader may have
    experienced this effect when in a crowded room, when they are able to single out
    and understand a single voice among the many others. We are able to almost filter
    out the unwanted sounds in the sense that we don’t process them, although we can
    still technically hear the noise. The only sound we process is the one we want
    to. In this example, the individual is purposefully filtering out the information.
    However, this effect can happen in many situations whether the individuals want
    it to happen or not. The simple reason for this is that our various senses receive
    far more information than we could ever hope to fully process. Therefore, the
    vast majority is buffered and our minds filter this information so that only the
    most important pieces get through. Attempts have been made to fully understand
    the details of this process such as the Broadbent, Treisman, Deutsch & Deutsch
    and Kahneman models for selective attention. A full discussion of these models
    is far beyond the scope of this book. However, the possibility of exploiting this
    phenomenon to aid in social engineer is within scope.

    Simons and Chabris. The video shows individuals, some dressed in black, others
    in white, passing basket balls to each other. The viewer is asked to count how
    many times the individuals dressed in white pass the basket ball. Approximately
    half way through the video a person in a gorilla costume walks to the center of
    the activity, waves at the camera and walks off the screen. At the end of the
    video the viewer is asked how many passes they counted. The vast majority of viewers
    do not notice the gorilla. I myself did not see it when watching this video for
    the first time and even had to watch it again from the beginning just to prove
    it was indeed there. The viewer’s attention is so transfixed on the complicated
    passing that they do not process the clearly obvious event of a gorilla waving
    right at them.

    of events that prevents the victim from processing certain information. Preventing
    victims from seeing the waving gorilla is obviously not that beneficial to a social
    engineer, however, the basic premise could be replicated to aid in an attack.
    All that social engineer needs to do is ensure the victim’s attention is focused
    on something complicated enough to prevent any other information from being processed.
    The “anything else” would of course be the element that achieves the objective.

- en: Personality typing has been around since ancient times and there have been many
    different models over the centuries. The various theories surrounding personality
    typing could fill many volumes. The idea of placing individuals into specific
    groups and then using those groups to predict their behavior has the potential
    for incredible applications. If you can accurately and consistently predict your
    own actions based on your own personality type, then you can use that knowledge
    to maximize your strengths and reduce your weaknesses. You could determine which
    people would be best assigned to certain tasks, build teams that cooperate effectively
    and gain great insight into disputes.

    on the target’s personality type to maximize the chances of affecting their decisions.
    This all sounds fantastic but unfortunately, as with many areas concerning human
    nature, personality typing is far from an exact science. You can certainly place
    individuals into personality type groups and even predict their actions with a
    pretty good degree of accuracy, but it is far from having a guaranteed outcome.
    The problem is that personality can change over time and no one really knows how
    personality is affected by influences such as genetics, upbringing, personal experiences
    and culture.

    challenges. Personalities shift and change by the moment based on circumstance
    and individuals may have a personality that spans multiple “distinct” groups depending
    on the model used to interpret it. The authors believe that influencing by personality
    type is not entirely practical in “short game” based real-world social engineering
    assessments. We fully expect many professional social engineers to react strongly
    to this statement claiming that they’ve consistently had great success. However,
    the authors stand by the belief that it should never form the basis for an attack,
    unless you have enough reconnaissance time and/or interaction with a target to
    be confident that a certain personality type-based approach would be effective.

    personality group and therefore responded more significantly to “authority” is
    not particularly valuable to a client. There are likely more pressing vulnerabilities
    concerning procedures, policies and awareness training that need to be identified
    and reported on first. However, that being said, there would be value in conducting
    awareness training based on how a social engineer may “attempt” to leverage certain
    personality types. Training workshops on the strengths and weaknesses of certain
    personality types could be quite beneficial to employees. The point here is not
    to make personality type issues a priority or even a focus until the more concrete
    security problems have been remediated.

    much has already been written on how to influence each specific type. However,
    in an attempt to keep the content of this book as “practical” as possible, we
    will only discuss the supporting technique that we as professional security consultants
    have regularly used during assessments. As a supporting technique, influencing
    based on personality types can increase the chances of success of certain social
    engineering scenarios. Generally speaking, a proof of concept is all that is required
    in each scenario, so one success is sufficient. Nevertheless, occasionally a greater
    degree of success can add a “worst-case scenario” element, which the client may
    find useful (as leverage to release security budget for example).

- en: The personality type model we regularly use is Jung’s theory of the “introvert”
    and the “extrovert.” This theory places everyone into two distinct categories
    with opposing behaviors. The introvert finds their internal reality to be more
    real and are generally motivated by subjective matters. Individuals within this
    category are described as being introverted, which is synonymous with being quiet,
    thoughtful and reserved. The extrovert finds external reality to be more real;
    they usually define their existence based on their relationship with other people.
    Extroverts are often described as being extroverted, which usually means confident,
    chatty and outgoing.

    reasons. First, it is relatively easy to determine which group an individual belongs
    to. Introverts tend to be quiet, shy and inward thinking, while extroverts are
    the complete opposite, and although this is certainly not always the case, it
    is consistent enough to have a practical application. Second, influencing each
    group is straightforward, based solely on the absolute basics of the theory. For
    example, as extroverts define their existence based on their relationships with
    others, then logically they will be more susceptible to techniques such as social
    proof. As introverts tend to be more subjective, placing ideas in terms of how
    it affects them personally would be more effective.

    extroverts with extroverts. Consequently, in terms of establishing good rapport
    with someone who is clearly an introvert, storming in with a big personality may
    not be entirely effective. Good rapport can have a significant effect on decisions
    made by the target, so mirroring their group can be very effective indeed.

    state that this is because we look for a partner that would compliment our personality,

    may be more effective at influencing an introvert male and vice versa.

    words. A much larger proportion is based on the pitch, speed and tone of the words.
    An even larger proportion still is based upon body language. To demonstrate this,
    imagine you have been summoned to your boss’s office for a dressing down. Your
    boss is stood with his hands on his hips towering over you, his face shows a look
    of general disdain. Their voice is booming as they describe how you’ve failed
    to meet their expectations in a recent project. Everything about this situation
    is unpleasant and communication is very clear; you’ve messed up in a big way.
    Now, suppose your boss is saying the exact same words, in the same booming voice,
    but this time is cowering in the corner of the room, sat with hands around his
    knees. This would be very odd indeed and you would likely not know what to make
    of it. Chances are you wouldn’t feel half as threatened and the words would lose
    all meaning. The body language takes precedence over the voice and words. Similarly,
    if your boss was to describe your failure to meet expectations in a squeaky mouse
    like voice, they probably wouldn’t have much impact at all.

    short in stature, they may use creative ways of overcoming these barriers. Such
    as the 5 ft 2 Regimental Sergeant Major (RSM), who has the most feared rank in
    the British Army, may place his desk on a raised plinth so that when subordinates
    are called in for disciplinary matters they will always be in a lower, subservient,

    techniques can be applied. The first way is to adjust your own body language to

    body language to support the impersonation of a chief executive. The other way
    is to “read” the body language of the target and adjust your approach accordingly.

    better to someone that is smiling. While this is generally true it is important
    to understand the difference between a real and a fake smile. A real smile can
    be seen in the eyes as the cheeks, sides of the eyes and eyebrows all raise up.
    A real smile is difficult to fake as the muscle movement involved tends to be
    subconscious. However, it is possible to fool a target into believing the smile
    is real and this can be extremely beneficial. If the target subconsciously picks
    up on an apparently genuine smile they will respond far more agreeably. Never

    to consider more than one element regarding an individual’s position concerning
    their arms and legs. For example, if someone has their arms and legs crossed and
    they’re sitting sideways on to you, then you can be pretty sure they’re not exactly
    engaged with you or what you’re saying. Whereas is they’re leaning across toward
    you with arms open they’re probably quite interested. Consequently, if the target
