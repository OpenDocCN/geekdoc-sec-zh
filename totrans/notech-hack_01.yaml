- en: When I got into this field, I knew I would have to stay ahead of the tech curve.
    I spent many sleepless nights worming through my home network trying to learn
    the ropes. My practice paid off. After years of hard work and dedicated study,
    I founded a small but elite pen testing team. I was good, my *foo* strong. Networks
    fell prostrate before me. My co-workers looked up to me, and I thought I was The
    Man. Then I met Vince.

- en: In his mid-40s, hawk-eyed, and vaguely European looking, Vince blended in with
    the corporate crowd; he was most often seen in a black leather trench coat, a
    nice dress shirt, dark slacks, black wing tips and the occasional black fedora.
    He had a definite aura. Tales of his exploits were legendary. Some said he had
    been a fed, working deep-black projects for the government. Other insisted he
    was some kind of mercenary genius, selling his dark secrets to the highest bidder.

- en: He was brilliant. He could do interesting and seemingly impossible things. He
    could pick locks, short-circuit electronic systems, and pluck information out
    of the air with fancy electronic gear. He once showed me a system he built called
    a “van Eck” something-or-other.^([1](#ft1)) It could sniff the electromagnetic
    radiation coming from a CRT and reassemble it, allowing him to eavesdrop on someone’s
    computer monitor from a quarter mile away. He taught me that a black-and-white
    TV could be used to monitor 900MHz cellular phone conversations. I still remember
    hunching over a table in my basement going at the UHF tuner post of an old black-and-white
    TV with a pair of needle-nosed pliers. When I heard a cellular phone conversation
    coming through that old TV’s speaker, I decided then and there I would learn everything
    I could from Vince.

    roles. I was to perform an internal assessment, which emulated an insider threat.
    If an employee went rogue, he could do unspeakable damage to a network. In order
    to properly emulate this, our clients provided us a workspace, a network jack,
    and the username and password of a legitimate, non-administrative user. I was
    tasked with leveraging those credentials to gain administrative control of critical
    network systems. If I gained access to confidential records stored within a corporate
    database, for example, my efforts were considered successful. I had a near-perfect
    record with internal assessments and was confident in my abilities.

- en: Vince was to perform a physical assessment that emulated an external physical
    threat. The facility had top-notch physical security. They had poured a ton of
    money into expensive locks, sensors, and surveillance gear. I knew Vince would
    obliterate them all with his high-tech superpowers. The gig looked to be a real
    slam-dunk with him working the physical and me working the internal. We were the
    “dream team” of security geeks.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When Vince insisted I help him with the physical part of the assessment, I just
    about fell over. I imagined a James Bond movie, with Vince as “Q” and myself (of
    course) as James Bond in ninja assault gear. Vince would supply the gadgets, like
    the van Eck thingamabob and I would infiltrate the perimeter and spy on their
    surveillance monitors or something. I giggled to myself about the unnatural things
    we would do to the electronic keypad systems or the proximity locks. I imagined
    the looks on the guard’s faces when we duct-taped them to their chairs after silently
    rappelling down from the ceiling of the surveillance room.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I couldn’t wait to get started. I told Vince to hand over the alien gadgets
    we would use to pop the security. When he told me he hadn’t brought any gadgets,
    I laughed and poked him. I never knew Vince was a kidder. When he told me he really
    didn’t bring any gear, I briefly considered pushing him over, but I had heard
    he was a black belt in like six different martial arts, so I just politely asked
    him what the heck he was thinking. He said we were going to be creative. The mercenary
    genius, the storm center of all the swirling rumors, hadn’t brought any gear.
    I asked him how creative a person could be when attacking a highly secured building
    without any gear. He just looked at me and gave me this goofy grin. I’ll never
    forget that grin.

    buildings and a few employee parking lots, all enclosed by protective fencing.
    Everyone came and went through a front gate. Fortunately, the gate was open and
    unguarded. With Vince driving, we rounded one building and parked behind it, in
    view of the loading docks.

    giving me crap. I followed the finger and saw a loading dock. Just past the bay
    doors, several workers carried packages around. “The loading dock?” I asked.

    you belong. Say hello to the employees. Be friendly. Comment on the weather.”

- en: I did, and I did. Then I did, and I did and I found myself inside. I walked
    around, picked up some blueprints of tanks and military-looking stuff, photocopied
    them and left. Just like that. I’m skipping the description of my heart pounding
    at 400 beats per minute and the thoughts of what military prison would be like
    and whether or not the rumors about Bubba were true, but I did it. And it was
    an incredible rush. It was social engineering at its simplest, and it worked wonders.
    No one questioned me. I suppose it was just too awkward for them. I couldn’t hide
    my grin as I walked to the car. Vince was nowhere to be found. He emerged from
    the building a few minutes later, carrying a small stack of letter-sized paper.

- en: I was Vince’s guinea pig but it didn’t really matter. I was thrilled and ready
    for more. The next building we targeted looked like an absolute fortress. There
    were no loading docks and the only visible entrance was the front door. It was
    wood and steel—too much like a castle door for my taste—and approximately six
    inches thick, sporting a proximity card-reader device. We watched as employees
    swiped a badge, pulled open the doors and walked in. I suggested we tailgate.
    I was on a roll. Vince shook his head. He obviously had other plans. He walked
    towards the building and slowed as we approached the front door. Six feet from
    the door, he stopped. I walked a step past him and turned around, my back to the
    door.

    about or even who the Bears were but he continued. “Man, that was something else.
    The way that team works together, it’s almost as if …” Vince stopped in mid-sentence
    as the front door opened. An employee pushed the door open, and headed towards
    the parking lot. “They move as a single unit,” he continued. I couldn’t help myself.
    I turned around. The door had already closed.

- en: Vince said strange stuff sometimes. That was just part of the package. It wasn’t
    crazy-person stuff, it was just stuff that most people were too dense to understand.
    I had a pretty good idea I had just witnessed his first crazy-person moment. “Let’s
    go,” he said. “I need a washcloth. I need to go back to the hotel.” I had no idea
    why he needed a washcloth, but I was relieved to hear he was still a safe crazy
    person. I had heard of axe murderers, but never washcloth murderers.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We passed the ride back to the hotel in silence; Vince seemed lost in his thoughts.
    He pulled up in front of the hotel, parked, and told me to wait for him. He emerged
    a few minutes later with a wire coat hanger and a damp washcloth. He tossed them
    into the back seat. “This should work,” he said, sliding into his seat and closing
    the doors. I was afraid to ask. Pulling away from the hotel, he continued. “I
    should be able to get in with these.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I gave him a look. I can’t exactly say what the look was, but I imagine it was
    somewhere between “I’ve had an unpleasant olfactory encounter” and “There’s a
    tarantula on your head.” Either way, I was pretty convinced he’d lost his mind
    or had it stolen by aliens. I pretended not to hear him. He continued anyhow.

    case of an emergency, exit doors must operate from the inside out without the
    user having any prior knowledge of its operation.” I blinked and looked up at
    the sky through the windshield. I wondered if the aliens were coming for me next.
    “Furthermore, the exit must not require the use of any key or special token. Exit
    doors are therefore very easy to get out of.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “This has something to do with that door we were looking at, doesn’t it?” I
    asked. The words surprised me. Vince and I were close to the same operating frequency.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He looked at me, and then I knew what *my look* looked like. I instinctively
    swatted at the tarantula that I could practically feel on my head. “This has *everything*
    to do with that door,” he said, looking out the front window and hanging a left.
    We were headed back to the site. “The front door of that facility,” he continued,
    “is formidable. It uses a very heavy-duty magnetic bolting system. My guess is
    that it would resist the impact of a 40-mile-an-hour vehicle. The doors are very
    thick, probably shielded, and the prox system is expensive.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Exactly. Did you notice the exit mechanism on the door?”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I hadn’t, and bluffing was out of the question. “No,” I admitted.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “You need to notice *everything,”* he said, pausing to glare at me. I nodded
    and he continued. “The exit mechanism is a silver-colored metal bar about waist-high.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I took my shot. “Oh, right. A push bar.” The term sounded technical enough.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “No, not a push bar.” Access denied. “The bar on that door is touch-sensitive.
    It doesn’t operate by pressure; it operates when it senses it has been touched.
    Very handy in a fire.” We pulled through the site’s gate and parked. Vince unbuckled
    and grabbed the hanger and the washcloth from the back seat. He had untwisted
    the hanger, creating one long straight piece of strong, thin wire. He folded it
    in half, laid the washcloth on one end and folded the end of the hanger around
    it, then bent the whole thing to form a funny 90-degree-angled white washcloth
    flag. I smartly avoided any comment about using it to surrender to the guards.
    “Let’s go,” he said.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We walked to the front door. It was nearly 6:00 P.M. and very few employees
    were around. He walked up to the door, jammed the washcloth end of the hangar
    between the doors at waist height and started twisting the hanger around. I could
    hear the washcloth flopping around on the other side of the door. Within seconds,
    I heard a muffled *cla-chunk* and Vince pulled the door open and walked inside.
    I stood there gawking at the door as it closed behind him. The door reopened,
    and Vince stuck his head out. “You coming?”

    had spent to secure that building, they learned that the entire system had been
    defeated with a washcloth and a wire coat hanger, all for want of a $50 gap plate
    for the door. The executives were incredulous and demanded proof, which Vince
    provided in the form of a field trip. I never learned what happened as a result
    of that demonstration, but I will never forget the lesson I learned: the simplest
    solutions are often the most practical.'

- en: Sure we could have messed with the prox system, figured out the magnetic tolerances
    on the lock or scaled the walls and used our welding torches—just like in the
    movies—to cut a hole in the ceiling, but we didn’t have to. This is the essence
    of no-tech hacking. It requires technical knowledge to reap the full benefit of
    a no-tech attack, but technical knowledge is not required to repeat it. Worst
    of all, despite the simplicity, a no-tech attack is perhaps the most deadly and
    misunderstood.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Through the years, I’ve learned to follow Vince’s advice. I now notice *everything*
    and I try to keep complicated thinking reigned in. Now, I’m hardly ever off duty.
    I constantly see new attack vectors, the most dangerous of which can be executed
    by anyone possessing the will to do so.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The key to no-tech hacking is to think simply, be aware, and to travel eyes
    open, head up. For example, when I go to a mall or some other socially dense atmosphere,
    I watch people. To me, strangers are an interesting puzzle and I reflexively try
    to figure out as much about them as I can. When I pass a businessman in an airport,
    my mind goes into overdrive as I try to sense his seat number and social status;
    make out his medical problems; fathom his family situation (or sense his sexual
    orientation); figure out his financial standing; infer his income level; deduce
    his dietary habits; and have a guess at his home address. When I go to a restaurant,
    I drift in and out of conversations around me, siphoning interesting tidbits of
    information. My attention wanders as I analyze my surroundings, taking it all
    in. When I walk through the parking lot of a building, I check out the vehicles
    along the way to determine what goes on inside and who the building’s residents
    might be. I do all this stuff not because of my undiagnosed attention deficit
    disorder but because it’s become a habit as a result of my job. I have personally
    witnessed the power of perception. When faced with tough security challenges,
    I don’t charge. I hang back and I watch. A good dose of heightened perception
    levels the playing field every time.
