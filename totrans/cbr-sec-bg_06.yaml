    and vary in different accounts.  It is unlikely that he had the range of access
    and responsibility he himself sometimes describes.  All parties do, however, confirm
    that he did have certain security administration privileges and that security
    administration was his primary role.

    extremely well.

    opportunity to internally exploit the organization’s cybersecurity vulnerabilities.

    closely and to prohibit them from also having operational access to the information
    in the same system.  For example, if you administered peoples’ access to their
    bank accounts, it would be a normal control for you to be prohibited from ever
    having or granting yourself permission to access those same accounts and the information
    they contain.

    and alert suspicious access.  However, recording who has ever accessed specific
    pieces of intelligence or other sensitive information is a double-edged sword. 
    Even top officials may need to occasionally access something without leaving a
    record of that access.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    monitor for suspicious actions, but he was either able to bypass them or to ensure
    that they did not raise any immediate, significant alerts.

    very closely.  Edward Snowden had a level of access privilege low enough to allow
    him to work independently but high enough to misuse to get into other higher value
    agency systems and devices.  This is evident from the extremely large number of
    files he was able to extract without being noticed.

    was too high for any individual to have.  This meant that he knew exactly how
    and where he could gain access to sensitive files without fear of immediate detection.
    His knowledge of security was not the issue; instead, the fact that he was able
    to gather enough insider knowledge to pinpoint specific and significant security
    gaps was the shortcoming that led to the breach.  As with all ‘secret’ information,
    various aspects of security knowledge need to be broken into pieces and never
    made available to the same person.

    of the minimum rights they require to do what they need to do.  For some roles,

    increases security vulnerabilities.

    security plan, complete with information about every layer of security present.
    These records can serve as building blueprints for identifying the weakest and
    most vulnerable points of entry, but they are also often subject to much less
    security than the information they protect.  For instance, the security plan might
    reveal that there is a network device that is the gateway to the organization’s
    most classified and confidential information.  I personally have been given security
    and network plans like this during an external audit. Although these documents
    are designed to evidence a strong security posture, granting access to this document,
    or even having it all in one place, is evidence to the contrary.

- en: Just like in the Target case, a number of security controls were missing.  This
    time, part of the reason (as stated by Edward Snowden) was that nobody regularly
    and accurately checked (audited) to ascertain whether or not the right controls
    were in place.  Snowden was not the only person who knew this, and many others
    with insider knowledge made similar comments after the incident occurred.  Secret
    environments are often, intentionally unaccountable.  In this case, the degree
    of unaccountability allowed it to escape audit, which in turn made it possible
    for a substantial number of security gaps to persist.

    they need to focus on improving their pre-screening processes.  However, it is

    passing pre-screening checks.  It is wishful thinking to believe that more stringent
    screening would have been an easy way to prevent the breach.  In Edward Snowden’s
    case, the only potential indicator of a hidden motive was his willingness to accept
    a drop in pay.
  prefs: []

    motives is still a good idea.  There is a lot of ongoing work on how personality
    profiling can help with this process.  This research is being conducted for a
    very valid reason – people are always the weakest link in the cybersecurity defense
    chain.  For that reason, we dedicate an entire chapter to human factors later
    in the book.

    for a contractor.  Contractors and other suppliers usually do exactly what the
    customer asks for, and if they are clever, they do nothing extra.  Doing extra
    things for free erodes margins.  What does this mean?  It means that any third
    party will not be giving away free security enhancements – they will only (usually)
    do exactly what you asked for and paid for.

    decision to live with the gaps.

    were using to monitor peoples’ digital systems.  He also identified the presence
    of authorized backdoors  that many of the major social media technologies had
    provided for use by government agencies.  These agencies find the backdoors useful,
    as they bypass the need to put large amounts of resources into breaking the encryption
    layer.

    the vulnerabilities they create are useful to attackers and usually far outweigh
