    of the target’s building, not just to the disclosure of sensitive information.

    deal of information to work with. The reconnaissance should have revealed all
    the employees, their positions and contact details, as well as all the information
    regarding the company itself. It has been seen how a single phone call can arrange
    for a pass or a meeting room, and this can be accomplished without ever setting
    foot on-site. However, as scarily effective as attacks of this kind are, they
    will likely fall short in businesses with a higher than average level of security.
    If the client has mature and tested security controls then the focus might need
    to be on the attributes of the actual building itself. Therefore, the telephone
    and e-mail attacks will need to gather information that will be useful in breaching
    the security of the building and in terms of what to expect once this has been
    achieved.

    but it is extremely useful. The fact we’re calling the security office obviously
    tells us they have a security guard, if only to watch the cameras. It was also
    discovered that to enter reception without speaking to them, a pass is needed.
    There is a car park and it’s secured with a barrier. Finally, the fact that a
    pass is not required to move around inside is critical; if access can be gained,
    it means free movement from department to department, floor to floor, without
    needing a pass or even to tailgate. This means that potentially an attacker could
    just tailgate in one of the entrances and be able to move around inside freely.
    If this is the case, then a tailgating scenario should be attempted at some point
    during the assessment.

    regarding a building’s security, actually visiting the site will provide the greatest
    insights. There may be physical security controls and building attributes that
    couldn’t possibly be discovered through remote means. For example, once on-site
    it could be discovered that they leave the rear fire door open all day long in
    summer. Identifying this physical vulnerability remotely would be challenging
    to say the least. However, this is not just talking about the painfully obvious
    physical vulnerabilities such as open doors, there is a huge amount of critical
    information that can be gathered on the target business, the employees and the
    physical security controls by actually visiting the site. As mentioned above,
    when testing high security clients it may be absolutely necessary to include a
    physical reconnaissance stage to fill in the missing jigsaw pieces that remote
    reconnaissance failed to obtain.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Dumpster diving has been briefly mentioned a few times already in this book,
    and this is hardly surprising as it is a truly classic technique. Strictly speaking,
    rummaging through someone’s garbage is hardly the pinnacle of psychological manipulation,
    but it’s not the act itself, it’s how the information is used. Is it legal? That
    depends on the intention, whether it’s a residence or a business and what country
    that the act is being carried out. Whether or not taking garbage is considered
    theft is debatable, but if the garbage is stored on company property then there
    will certainly be an aspect of trespassing if there is an attempt to obtain it
    without permission. However, in terms of a social engineering assessment, permission
    should have been granted to execute such scenarios.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    For example, making a call as a health and safety inspector, the garbage collection
    company, or any other third party that interacts with it in some way. There may
    be a specific company that collects media or documents for secure and safe disposal.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If some of these questions can be answered, then you may be able to simply walk
    up and collect the garbage. For example, it may be discovered that there are bins
    to the rear of the business with no security controls of any kind. Arriving at
    night and covertly taking the bags away for inspection could be a simple task.
    Remember that it’s far less risky to take the bags away, rather than spending
    time on-site going through it all.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Bear in mind that garbage is being dealt with here and unless it is known exactly
    what goes into each bag, prepare for the worst. Wear heavy-duty safety gloves,
    goggles and appropriate clothing. Don’t jump in the bins, just take the bags out
    cleanly and transport them off-site to a suitable area in which their contents
    can be inspected.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If the garbage area is secured, then there may be a need to design an appropriate
    pretext to gain access. This is where the reconnaissance regarding who normally
    gains access becomes useful. A basic scenario could be to contact the security
    guard and impersonate an employee. The consultant warns the security guard that
    an inspector from the xyzgarbage company will be coming to site to do some basic
    checks. Then by arriving as the xyzgarbage inspector, the only challenge would
    be to convince the security guard of the need to be left alone, “*I have quite
    a bit to do, shall I come see you again on my way out?*”. Or the engineer could
    impersonate an employee and explain to the security guard that an important document
    has been accidentally binned and could they provide access to the area to enable
    a look through the bins?

    USB drives, hard drives, scraps of paper containing passwords, network diagrams,
    documents with lists of employees, etc. This is the obvious stuff and there shouldn’t
    really be a need for a book to articulate how useful information like this can
    be. If there is one practical piece of advice the authors can give regarding dumpster
    driving, it would be to consider ANY piece of business specific information that
    isn’t already known as being useful. Yes, finding passwords on Post-It notes would
    be fantastic, but don’t dismiss other potentially key pieces of information. For
    example, what about finding a printout of an e-mail conversation that someone
    has binned. Can the knowledge of that conversation be used to advantage to gain
    credibility? Has an employee thrown away some delivery parcel packaging along
    with the receipt that’s usually included? As this will contain details of the
    item and delivery, that enables the impersonation; either of the business that
    provided the item or the delivery company that dropped it off.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Shoulder surfing is another information gathering technique that is often described
    as social engineering. However, in the similar way to dumpster diving, it is not
    the technique itself but the way the gathered information is used. In its most
    basic sense, shoulder surfing is looking over someone’s shoulder to see what they
    are doing; typing, writing, etc. For example, an employee may covertly look across
    at their colleague’s keyboard as they type their password or look at a monitor
    as an e-mail is being composed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It could be argued that there would be little benefit in employing this technique,
    as access to the target building has already been achieved. Having breached the
    security, knowing an employee’s password may be of some use, but it would be far
    easier to plug in a device and attack the network remotely. This is true, but
    the employees are not “always” within the target building. For example, although
    very much a long game technique, an attacker could shoulder surf an employee using
    their laptop in a local cafe. If the password could be seen, it could then be
    used to access the corporate e-mail. This could then be used to launch phishing
    e-mail attacks.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Looking for passwords is obvious, but remember that a social engineer can potentially
    use any information to attack the business. Consider the cafe example again, what
    else could the attacker see? They would be able to see operating system version,
    the web browser, the software they’re using, and the make and model of the laptop.
    This is all very useful information that can aid an attacker when launching phishing
    attacks. Knowing the software used can narrow down the attacks that are likely
    to work.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When targeting a physical building, the idea of taking photographs seems like
    a sensible thing to do. There have been many examples in the movies and television
    shows where a team of professionals covertly photograph the target building and
    the associated employees. Is this necessary in modern-day social engineering?
    The rather predictable answer is that it depends. Generally speaking photographing
    the building is often not necessary, as a quick visit to GoogleMaps Streetview
    will provide clear enough shots of the building’s exterior. If online photographs
    cannot be obtained then resorting to employing time to take photographs instead
    is only really necessary if there is something relevant to include in the report.
    The fact is, the client knows what their building looks like, they go there every
    day. Therefore, including a selection of photographs of the exterior won’t be
    that useful to them. However, if it is difficult to get close enough to take photos,
    due to security controls, then doing so proves certain vulnerabilities. In this
    sense, the act of taking the photographs becomes significant. Another situation
    where photographs of the building should be included is if they point out a specific
    vulnerability. For example, a particular assessment performed by the authors revealed
    an external doorway secured with a cheap pin-tumbler lock. Above the door were
    three security cameras mounted on a pole, none of which covered the door or the
    pathway leading to the door. This was an obvious issue and so photographs were
    included.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once access has been gained to the building, photographs are usually used to
    “prove” access to the objective. Therefore, photographs may be taken of a restricted
    area or a particular object defined in the scope of the assessment. However, this
    is use of photography to prove an objective has been met, not for the purposes
    of active information gathering.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If the target site is very high security and the possibility of being caught
    on camera is likely, then photography can be useful to map out certain security
    controls. Once the location, direction, make and model of the cameras has been
    ascertained, theoretically scenarios can be made to avoid them. However, this
    would only be necessary if planning a “smash and grab” approach whereby all activity
    needed to be convert. Remember that scenarios of this type are risky, only identify
    a handful of vulnerabilities, may not map to the client’s actual risks and should
    always be attempted last.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the best ways to use photography when on-site is to capture images of
    the employees, what they wear, what color lanyard they have and their access badge.
    This can be easy enough using a mobile phone, just remember to turn it to silent
    as the sound of the photograph being taken may rapidly give away any operation!
    As mentioned many times in this book, the smoking area is a great place to interact
    with employees with minimal suspicion. As the employees tend to be kept quite
    close together in these areas, capturing images is fairly straightforward.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Receptionists tend to get a great deal of focus on social engineering assessments
    for many reasons already discussed in this book. If a receptionist can be compromised
    then breaching the security of the business becomes extremely easy. However, this
    concept should extend to the reception area itself. Generally speaking this is
    the gatehouse, the point at which any employee, contractor or visitor is screened
    and hopefully authenticated before being allowed through. Therefore, if fundamental
    vulnerabilities can be found in the reception area itself, they could be leveraged
    to great effect in an attack scenario.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There have been cases when the authors have discovered images of the target’s
    reception on their own social media page. However, it is likely that the reconnaissance
    will not reveal this information and the only way to obtain it is to physically
    be there in reception. Does this mean that this information can only be obtained
    and used at the point of executing an actual scenario? No, there are many reasons
    why someone might possibly be in reception. For example, being lost and simply
    asking for directions or perhaps even having mistakenly walked into the wrong
    business, although be careful not to use the same consultant in the actual attack
    as the receptionists may well recognize them.

    risk of being challenged. The business is providing an area with services that
    can be utilized by anyone. A good example of this would be a hospital; in most
    cases people can freely walk in and sit in the canteen or various waiting areas
    without being questioned. These areas present a very serious security situation
    for that business. In an ideal world that area would be completely locked down
    with no network connections to the actual corporate network and no services or
    available information that could be used to attack it. However, this is rarely
    the case and public access areas tend to be major weaknesses waiting to be exploited
    by attackers.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    to potentially learn the building layout. They could theoretically stay in that

    for when the receptionists change over or when the security guard leaves.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As mentioned in the previous section, public access areas often have public
    access terminals and network points. Hopefully, the network points should have
    been disabled or be physically inaccessible; an attacker will definitely be checking
    if they get the chance. As for the public access terminals, even if they don’t
    have connections to the corporate network, do they have any passwords that are
    reused? Perhaps a highly privileged user on the corporate network reuses the local
    administrator password on that terminal. How is the terminal itself secured? The
    authors have seen situations where the terminal was “secured” in a small cabinet

    be used to make outbound connections (backdoors). A rogue access point is one
    way this could be accomplished. If an attacker could plug in a “rogue” wireless
    access point, they could attack the network from a safe distance, such as the
    car park or even further with specialist equipment. However, it is worth mentioning
    rogue access points within this chapter in terms of their ability to remotely
    gather information.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    an attacker could set one up outside the building. If employees were to connect
    to this wireless network, their traffic could be intercepted and parsed for useful
    information including passwords. The attacker would set up an open wireless network
    broadcasting an SSID such as “OpenWifi” or “Free Internet Access.” If they wanted
    to target employees in the IT department, they could enable WEP encryption, hoping
    that the more technical employees would be tempted to try and hack into it and
    use the services.

    the access point. This is an effective technique and if successful it could provide
    a foothold onto the corporate network. For example, by compromising an employee’s

    connects to the corporate network. However, such an attack scenario begins to
    stray away from the focus of social engineering.

    passwords) and could breach acts such as the Human Rights Act 1998\. Gaining access
    to employee’s corporate e-mail account is quite different from gaining access
    to their personal e-mail account.

    shows. The idea of adorning a fake moustache and thick glasses to fool a security

    to look the part. As previous chapters have discussed, impersonation is about
    looking, sounding and acting exactly as the impersonated character would. Therefore,
    any social engineering kit should contain clothing and items to suit all manner
    of different characters. This would be everything from smart suits to overalls,
    clipboards, brief cases, toolkits, etc. Take the time to create a series of uniforms
    for fake companies and for companies that actually exist, though not the emergency
    services of course! In addition, think about the finer details, spend the money
    to have the logos embroidered rather than just printed, include matching baseball
    caps if appropriate, and even custom lanyards with the company name on.

    be thought of as supporting items and not the basis of an attack. Do not create
    a scenario based on waving a clipboard at a security guard to make the visit look
    official. The items are there to make the impersonation more convincing and to
    achieve better credibility so that the main scenario can be executed with increased
    chances of success. For example, if a clipboard is to be carried, consider printing
    off a fake letter with the target business’s logo at the top. Any onlooker that
    sees the logo would likely assign instant credibility, probably without even thinking
    much about it.

    hardhat. The idea is that most people wouldn’t think to question someone dressed
    in that way. A social engineer could walk around the target site with a colleague,
    pointing to rooftops and writing on a clipboard. Any onlookers would assume they
    are carrying out an inspection of some sort and think little more about it. This
    technique is quite dated now and most awareness training programs will likely
    cover it. If the plan is on using this impersonation then think carefully about
    the details. A common mistake is to purchase brand-new high visibility vests and
    hardhats, which stand out as somewhat unusual. How many workmen are seen with
    a pristine outfit? When the authors originally built up the wardrobe of social
    engineering clothing, they swapped brand-new high visibility vests and hats for
    used ones. Unfortunately, the used items stank of diesel but at least they looked
    authentic, because they were. If nothing else, this combination of clothing can
    be used when dumpster diving as anyone with a legitimate reason to interact with
    the garbage will be wearing similar if not identical clothing.

    and authorization. The badge would typically show the individual’s name, position,
    department, a photograph, the business name, the business logo and other miscellaneous
    information. The badge itself may also be equipped with RFID or magnetic strip
    and enable the employee to authenticate themselves to pass certain physical security
    controls. In secure environments, the employees are told to ensure their badge
    is visible at all times. Contractors and visitors will likely be given a different
    type of badge, possibly with a very different format, or their badge may just
    be a paper temporary badge ripped out of a sign-in book.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As previously mentioned, it is not challenging to covertly take photos of the
    badges currently in use. As security best practices encourage staff to keep them
    visible, this task is made all the easier. What is frequently found is that employees
    continue to wear their badges over the clothes when walking to work, going out
    for lunch or when they make their way home. Therefore, a social engineer has the
    opportunity to create a fake badge to gain credibility and make an impersonation
    more convincing. All that is required is a basic photo editing software package
    and a very convincing copy can be created. Remember that employee badges are often
    just a logo (which can be sourced online), a photograph (which can be locally
    reproduced) and a few lines of text. If the plan is to execute a scenario that
    involves an impersonation of an employee from another branch, then the fake pass
    may be all that’s required to prove the identity.
  prefs: []

    RFID or magnetic strip, so this will need to be accounted for in the scenario.
    If the pass is held up to a reader and nothing happens, try shrugging it off and
    saying to the person behind that it’s playing up again. Would they challenge someone
    on that? Probably not, especially if the pass looks convincing and you look irate
    enough about the situation.

    of an RFID token. However, the use of these devices is beyond the scope of this
    book. Additionally, think carefully about what is trying to be proven and how
    this can be achieved. If it is known that a client’s particular RFID implementation
    uses passes that can be replayed or even cloned, then all that may be required
    is to inform the client. They can then weigh the risk against the cost of a complete
    replacement of the authentication system, without needing to go through elaborate
    social engineering scenarios.

    badges backward, so only the featureless card holder is showing. The authors have
    seen this in practice and it is of course folly, as the social engineer wouldn’t
    even need to make a fake badge, they would just wear an empty card holder backward.
    The best defense is to have different formatted badges and different colored lanyards
    depending on the employee’s position or department. This means that a social engineer
    would have to work out what color or format goes with which department or risk
    standing out.

    attackers and professional security consultants alike. The basic premise is to
    leverage an employee’s access privileges by following closely behind them as they
    authenticate to physical security controls such as RFID. Most of us are socially
    conditioned to hold a door open for people behind to be polite and courteous.
    If the door isn’t held open, the person behind may be offended. If simply not
    holding the door open could cause offence, then what would challenging the person
    to prove their identity do?
  prefs: []

    have an argument on the phone, carrying an apparently heavy item or even turning
    up with crutches. Anything that can be done to make the individual less likely
    to want to challenge is for the better.

    The authors have worked with clients that threaten staff with disciplinary action
    if they don’t literally close the door behind them despite another person waiting
    to come through it, essentially ending up with a row of people taking it in turn
    to open and close the door behind them. This method is seemingly effective but
    only against short game attack scenarios. The employees are all fully aware of
    the procedure, but new third-party contractors and visitors won’t be. If an attacker
    could find out when such a contractor or visitor is due to arrive, they could
    tailgate behind. Additionally, a social engineer could arrive as a visitor with
    a colleague tailgating behind.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are other, more expensive solutions such as single person turnstiles or
    the ultimate man-trap authentication system. These physical security controls
    are specifically designed to prevent tailgating. For example, with a man-trap
    an individual has to be authenticated once to enter a small space that can generally
    only accommodate one person. They then become “trapped” within the compartment
    until they are authenticated a second time. Some systems will actually assign
    a weight to an individual’s authentication details, to ensure they’re not literally
    carrying someone else through the system. Although these systems prevent tailgating
    they are not without their vulnerabilities. For example, the authors have seen
    man-trap systems that allow the same card to be used to enter the system multiple
    times, rather than having to leave first. This means that a valid pass could be
    used to allow multiple individuals through.

    to be used toward the end of an assessment. The reason for this is that tailgating
    can be very risky, especially if there aren’t convincing credentials or a good
    cover story. No matter how much effort is put into preventing a challenge from
    employees, it could still easily happen. Therefore, by executing tailgating based
    scenarios at the beginning of test you could jeopardize the entire assessment.
    Tailgating is an important technique to use but should be attempted last.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The authors have known security companies to base entire assessments around
    tailgating. For example, the client will say that every year a group of consultants
    walk around the building and try to get in. This is of “some” value to the client,
    but as this book has emphasized multiple times, this should only be one among
    many techniques aligned with the client’s actual risks. Therefore, unless the
    client’s main risks are from members of the public tailgating into the building
    and stealing from them, this technique should be an addition to an assessment
    and not a basis for one.

    to prevent for some time. However, as an assessor think carefully about what vulnerabilities
    are attempted and how tailgating may fit into the overall approach.

- en: Originally lock picking was not going to be included in this book, as the subject
    matter has been covered thoroughly and elegantly by authors such as Deviant Ollam
    in books such as “Practical Lock Picking” and “Keys to the Kingdom”. There is
    no doubt that if the plan is to break into a building or offices within that building,
    then a skill such as lock picking can be very useful indeed. However, rather than
    attempting to condense the vast amount of material into a few pages, it was decided
    instead to provide a take on the practicalities of using lock picking in social
    engineering scenarios.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First and foremost, lock picking can “potentially” damage a lock. In the vast
    majority of cases, the damage will not affect the lock, but the chance is always
    there. Therefore, it is important to include this in the rules of engagement with
    the client. They need to be aware of the risk, however small, and make a decision
    as to whether the technique can be used. The importance of this became very clear
    with one particular client who stipulated from the very beginning that under no
    circumstances was lock picking to be attempted. When inquires were made as to
    why, the client stated that previous consultants had used the techniques without
    informing them. What those consultants didn’t realize is that if any one lock
    was damaged and had to be replaced, then every other single lock would also need
    to be replaced. The cost of doing this was huge in this particular situation.
    Therefore, attempts to carry out any lock picking were avoided, but as part of
    the assessment additional security controls in certain areas were recommended,
    as real attackers wouldn’t care if the locks were damaged or not.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When considering the use of lock picking to access the building, such as an
    external door, be very wary indeed! It is important to consider whether or not
    what is on the other side of that door is known. Imagine successfully picking
    the lock and entering into a packed office with everyone turning around to see.
    An obvious solution would be to perform the lock picking at night, though assessments
    performed in this fashion have their own set of risks. For example, what about
    handing over a “get out of jail free” letter to the police rather than an employee?
    Additionally, real attackers would likely just break a window or force a door,
    which is something generally outside of scope for most assessments.

- en: The best use of lock picking is of course inside the building. Most cabinets,
    cupboard and drawers are secured with cheap wafer locks, most if not all of which
    can by easily bypassed in seconds. Bear in mind that their objective may be proof
    of access to sensitive documents, in which case gaining access to cabinets may
    be essential. Of course, scenarios could be designed to make employees willingly
    open the cabinets or retrieve documents, lock picking is just one available option.

    lock. It could take a few seconds, a few minutes, or even longer. Additionally,
    when someone is crouched down messing with a lock, they are likely to raise suspicion
    very quickly if anyone sees them. Therefore, only attempt to pick a lock if there’s
    enough confidence of not being detected. Sometimes, if caught unawares, then explaining
    they are a locksmith and that the client has lost the keys can be enough, with
    luck.

    will focus on the various ways that objective could be accomplished. However,
    there are many cases where gaining access to the building is just the beginning
    of the assessment. The client may well want to explore other areas such as how
    susceptible employees are to social engineering from on-site attackers, or if
    passwords written down on scraps of paper really do pose a significant risk. This
    is where multiple scenarios will need to be stringed together and executed seamlessly
    from one to the other. There is always the possibility of changing tact or creating
    new scenarios if the opportunity is seen, but be careful to adhere to the client’s
    objectives and actual risks.

    and logging onto an employee’s workstation, either by obtaining their password
    or having them log in. Gaining access to the building was achieved and we moved
    from department to department attempting a series of very simple scenarios. We
    approached an employee explaining that we were working with IT department to try
    and track down some issues they were having. We kept it fairly vague unless we
    were questioned further. We asked if any of the workstations or hot desks were
    available. Once we sat down and attempted to login we then approached the same
    employee explaining that the credentials provided by IT weren’t working, could
    they login for us? Combined with a polite attitude and throwing in phrases such
    as “*really sorry to bother you again…*”, the employees were more than happy to
    oblige. At this point, if we were real attackers we would have been free to attack
    the network or install backdoors. As we moved from department to department, we
    would attempt a different scenario designed to identify a different set of vulnerabilities.

    to take stock and to prepare for the next scenario. This can be an empty meeting
    room, a canteen, or if the situation is dire enough, a bathroom can always be
    used. For example, gain access to the building posing as an electrical engineer,
    then head to a bathroom to change into a smart suit. The next scenario may be
    based on an internal audit or as a new starter at the business. A relatively safe
    area such as a meeting room could be used to prepare or even to attack the network,
    providing the network points are live. If anyone enters the room, simply apologize
    explaining that you thought it was free at that time. Canteens are always a good
    place to prepare an approach as these areas will see traffic from employees, visitors
    and contractors regularly, so you are unlikely to be challenged.
