    technological conditions. The technical resources needed to execute phishing attacks
    can be readily acquired through public and private sources. Some technical resources
    have been streamlined and automated, allowing use by non-technical criminals.

    support company representative makes verbal contact with the victim, the criminal
    tries to convince the victim to provide remote access to the victim’s device.

    control of the victim’s device and bank account. With this access, the criminal
    makes it appear as if too much money was refunded to the victim’s account and
    requests the victim return the difference back to the criminal’s company via a
    wire transfer or pre-paid cards. In reality, there was no refund at all. Instead,
    the criminal transferred funds among the victims own accounts (checking, savings,
    retirement, etc.) to make it appear as though funds were deposited. The victim

- en: The FTC has been hearing about a social engineering attack targeting people
    who are selling their cars online. Sellers get calls or texts from people who
    claim to be interested in buying the car but first want to see a car history report.
    They ask the seller to get the report from a specific website, where the seller
    needs to enter some information and pay about $20 by credit card for the report.
    The seller then sends it to the supposed buyer but never hears back. When the
    car sellers go to one of these websites, they’re automatically redirected to sites
    ending in .vin, which seems like it might be related to a car’s vehicle identification
    number (VIN). Scammers hope they will think that, but no. In this case, .vin is
    a relatively new website domain like .com or .org that groups can apply to use.
    This domain was intended to be used for sites that relate to wine, since vin is
    the French word for wine, but others are not prevented from using it. So yes,
    that’s a clever take on .vin for cars. However, sellers still might want to think
    twice if anyone asks them to do car-related business on a site ending in .vin.
    Sellers may have no way of knowing who operates the site, especially if it’s one
    they have never heard of. It might be a ruse to get personal information, including
    credit card account numbers. It also could be a way for companies called lead
    generators to get information, which they sell to third parties for advertising
    and marketing purposes. [^(12)](#re_TNF-CH003_CIT00012)

    including 16 foreign nationals, for their involvement in an online auction fraud
    scheme designed to defraud users looking to purchase merchandise via the Internet.
    It is alleged that this transnational organized fraud ring stole millions of dollars
    from unsuspecting victims across the United States in a sophisticated fraud scheme
    that relied on the increasing popularity of e-commerce marketplaces such as Craigslist^(TM)
    and eBay^(TM). Using these sites, fraudsters post false advertisements for merchandise
    that does not exist. Then, using a multitude of social engineered and convincing
    methods, these cybercriminals persuade victims to send money for the non-existent
    goods.

- en: The indictment alleged that the defendants participated in a criminal conspiracy
    primarily located in Alexandria, Romania, that engaged in a large-scale scheme
    of online auction fraud. Specifically, Romania-based members of the conspiracy
    and their associates posted false advertisements to popular online auction and
    sales websites such as Craigslist^(TM) and eBay^(TM) for high-cost goods (typically
    vehicles) that did not actually exist. According to the indictment, these members
    would convince American victims to send money for the advertised goods by crafting
    persuasive narratives, for example, by impersonating a military member who needed
    to sell the advertised item before deployment. The members of the conspiracy are
    alleged to have created fictitious online accounts to post these advertisements
    and communicate with victims, often using the stolen identities of Americans to
    do so. [^(13)](#re_TNF-CH003_CIT00013)

    cyber attacks that caused unprecedented economic damage and disruption to businesses
    in the United States and around the globe. The FBI traced the attacks back to
    the source and mapped their commonalities, including similarities among the various
