    the victim offering a refund for tech support services previously rendered. The

    control of the victim’s device and bank account. With this access, the criminal
    makes it appear as if too much money was refunded to the victim’s account and
    requests the victim return the difference back to the criminal’s company via a
    wire transfer or pre-paid cards. In reality, there was no refund at all. Instead,
    the criminal transferred funds among the victims own accounts (checking, savings,
    retirement, etc.) to make it appear as though funds were deposited. The victim

    to the victim’s virtual currency wallet and transfers the victim’s virtual currency
    to another wallet for temporary holding during maintenance. The virtual currency
    is never returned to the victim, and the criminal ceases all communication. Criminals

    They ask the seller to get the report from a specific website, where the seller
    needs to enter some information and pay about $20 by credit card for the report.
    The seller then sends it to the supposed buyer but never hears back. When the
    car sellers go to one of these websites, they’re automatically redirected to sites
    ending in .vin, which seems like it might be related to a car’s vehicle identification
    number (VIN). Scammers hope they will think that, but no. In this case, .vin is
    a relatively new website domain like .com or .org that groups can apply to use.
    This domain was intended to be used for sites that relate to wine, since vin is
    the French word for wine, but others are not prevented from using it. So yes,
    that’s a clever take on .vin for cars. However, sellers still might want to think
    twice if anyone asks them to do car-related business on a site ending in .vin.
    Sellers may have no way of knowing who operates the site, especially if it’s one
    they have never heard of. It might be a ruse to get personal information, including
    credit card account numbers. It also could be a way for companies called lead

- en: In November 2014, the conspirators launched a destructive attack on Sony Pictures
    Entertainment (SPE) in retaliation for the movie The Interview, a farcical comedy
    that depicted the assassination of the DPRK’s leader. The conspirators gained
    access to SPE’s network by sending malware to SPE employees, and then stole confidential
    data, threatened SPE executives and employees, and damaged thousands of computers.
    Around the same time, the group sent spear phishing messages to other members
    in the entertainment industry, including a movie theater chain and a UK-based
    company that was producing a fictional series involving a British nuclear scientist
    taken prisoner in DPRK.

    part of the cyber heist, the conspiracy accessed the bank’s computer terminals
    that interfaced with the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication
    (SWIFT) communication system after compromising the bank’s computer network with
    spear phishing emails. It then sent fraudulently authenticated SWIFT messages
    directing the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to transfer funds from Bangladesh
    to accounts in other Asian countries. The conspiracy attempted to and gained access
    to several other banks in various countries from 2015 through 2018 using similar
    methods and watering hole attacks, attempting the theft of at least $1 billion
    through such operations.

    including Lockheed Martin, with spear phishing emails. These malicious emails
    used some of the same aliases and accounts seen in the SPE attack, at times accessed
    from North Korean IP addresses, and contained malware with the same distinct data
    table found in the malware used against SPE and certain banks, the complaint alleged.
    The spear phishing emails sent to the defense contractors were often sent from
    email accounts that purported to be from recruiters at competing defense contractors,
    and some of the malicious messages made reference to the Terminal High Altitude
    Area Defense (THAAD) missile defense system deployed in South Korea. The attempts
    to infiltrate the computer systems of Lockheed Martin, the prime contractor for
    the THAAD missile system, were not successful.

    significant impact on the United Kingdom’s National Health Service. The conspiracy
    is connected to the development of WannaCry 2.0, as well as two prior versions
    of the ransomware, through similarities in form and function to other malware
    developed by the hackers, and by spreading versions of the ransomware through
    the same infrastructure used in other cyber attacks.

    to delinquency while others have had a global financial and business impact. Activities
    like the Tech Support Scam and Business Email Compromise have impacted thousands
    of businesses and private computer users. Some social engineering efforts like
    those of North Korea and Avalanche have been subparts of larger criminal conspiracies.
    This chapter has reviewed real-world exploits and crimes involving social engineering.
