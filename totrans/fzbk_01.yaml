  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Welcome to "The Fuzzing Book"!** Software has bugs, and catching bugs can
    involve lots of effort. This book addresses this problem by *automating* software
    testing, specifically by *generating tests automatically*. Recent years have seen
    the development of novel techniques that lead to dramatic improvements in test
    generation and software testing. They now are mature enough to be assembled in
    a book – even with executable code.'

    testing; as *supplementary material* in a software testing, security testing,
    or software engineering course; and as a *resource for software developers*. We
    cover random fuzzing, mutation-based fuzzing, grammar-based test generation, symbolic
    testing, and much more, illustrating all techniques with code examples that you
    can try out yourself.

- en: This book is written by *Andreas Zeller, Rahul Gopinath, Marcel Böhme, Gordon
    Fraser, and Christian Holler*. All of us are long-standing experts in software
    testing and test generation; and we have written or contributed to some of the
    most important test generators and fuzzers on the planet. As an example, if you
    are reading this in a Firefox, Chrome, or Edge Web browser, you can do so safely
    partly because of us, as *the very techniques listed in this book have found more
    than 2,600 bugs in their JavaScript interpreters so far.* We are happy to share
    our expertise and making it accessible to the public.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H4
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The interactive notebook uses the [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org) service,
    which runs notebooks on their own servers. Starting Jupyter through mybinder.org
    normally takes about 30 seconds, depending on your Internet connection. If, however,
    you are the first to invoke binder after a book update, binder recreates its environment,
    which will take a few minutes. Reload the page occasionally.

    to understand usage patterns and workloads for future project evolution. While
